<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> medical man who will study to investigate as far
as possible, in every case, the original channel through
which disease or constitutional disorder first found its entry
into the system, will be astonished at the mass of human
suffering which may be traced up to a venereal origin,
although its primary symptoms may have been for years
apparently eradicated from the frame. The malady generally
commences its attack in early life, before experience
has overcome the short-sighted heedlessness of youth, and
taught it to look beyond the pains and pleasures of the
passing moment. Delicacy or shame will not allow him to
seek assistance, until the poison has acquired strength and
virulence too alarming to be neglected; and the patient
then, instead of applying to his usual professional friends,
flies to some empirical practitioner, who temporarily arrests
the external symptoms, and discharges him as cured. Thus
matters go on, until the malady becomes constitutional; and
the patient is at last compelled to place himself under the
treatment of those who, at an earlier period, might have
preserved his constitution untainted, and his body comparatively
uninjured by the ravages of this insidious disease.</p>

<p>Some years ago the idea first occurred to me that a popular
treatise, divested as much as possible of technical
phraseology, explaining to the non-medical reader the
structure and anatomy of the parts primarily affected by
the venereal disease, and describing its first as well as its
subsequent and aggravated symptoms, and pointing out the
safest treatment of it in inexperienced hands, while in its
simple form, would be of much avail in counteracting the
effects of the complaint resulting from mal-treatment or
neglect among the young and thoughtless. This work is
intended to teach him where serious danger exists, or may
be apprehended; for the treatment in a great degree, and
under any circumstances, must fall upon the patient himself:
and every medical man knows that, in very many instances,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
those who are fully alive to the injury that may
arise from such self-management, are yet reduced, by considerations
of delicacy and secrecy, to practise it; and it is
hoped that a perusal will contribute to give him a knowledge
and confidence which he never could acquire from the
uneducated empiric. Under these impressions have I ventured
to submit the following pages; and while I hope their
utility may be acknowledged, I would remark, that they are
not intended to supersede medical aid in any stage of the
disorder, but that, on the contrary, I would impress upon
the reader, if he need it, the prudence of having immediate
recourse to a well-educated physician in the earliest stages
of the disease, and to beware of advertising quacks. But
where, from circumstances which, in venereal complaints,
very frequently occur, the party can not have recourse to
professional aid, the next best step is certainly to place in
his hands a formula of that treatment which is most likely
to be successful with himself.</p>

<p>In thus publicly unfolding the mysteries of this department
of the profession, I expect some reprehension from
those who assume that all medical knowledge should be limited
to the regular practisers of the science; but I would
fain remind all parties that, although this branch of medical
writing has hitherto been in the hands of mercenary
empirics, it is equally conducive to the honor of the profession,
and the interest of the patient, that these pretenders
should be driven from the field. Conscious of my integrity
as a regularly educated surgeon, and not altogether destitute
of successful practice to rest my claim upon, it is with
less hesitation I depart from professional ceremony; and
whatever opinion may be pronounced, as to my success in
performing the task I have undertaken, I may be allowed
to hope, without arrogance, that I am at least entitled to
the praise of industry and humanity.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">GENERAL REMARKS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> diseases known by the general term of <i>syphilis</i> or
<i>venereal disease</i>, and arising from impure coition, appear
generally in three forms, <i>gonorrhœa</i>, <i>chancres</i>, and <i>bubo</i>.
These sometimes exist alone, and sometimes together. As
they affect the genital organs and their appendages, a description
of these organs is necessary to a full understanding
of the subject.</p>

<p><i>Genital organs and appendages in the male.</i>—This term
embraces the <i>penis</i>, <i>testicles</i>, <i>bladder</i>, and <i>kidneys</i>. The
form of the penis is familiar to every one. It commences
at the bladder, is of a <i>spongy</i> nature, and is composed of
three different parts; the two upper and larger are called
the <i>cavernous</i> bodies, and the lower the <i>spongy</i> body; these
bodies are covered by the skin which comes over the head
of the penis, and forms the <i>prepuce</i>. When this skin is
drawn back, the head of the penis, or the <i>glans</i> penis is
seen, which is a development of the spongy body, and is
extremely sensitive. A whitish secretion, with a peculiar
odor, forms at the end of the glans, where the prepuce
seems to join it. The object of this secretion is to preserve
the sensitiveness of the glans, and to facilitate the
withdrawal of the prepuce in coition and in urinating. This
material sometimes collects, irritates, hardens, and causes
much inconvenience. This can be done away with by
circumcision, which is performed as follows:—draw an
inked line on the skin of the prepuce, corresponding to
the base of the glans penis; draw the prepuce forward,
and have the inked part held firmly by an assistant with a
pair of forceps. Then the surgeon takes that part of the
prepuce projecting beyond the forceps with his left hand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
and with a bistoury cuts the prepuce at the inked line with
his right. When this is done, the lining skin of the prepuce,
which cannot be drawn forward, remains entire, and
covers the glans; this lining is divided by a single cut
with the scissors: then the flaps are removed round to the
frenum, and then the two flaps are held together and removed,
with the frenum, at one cut. The mode of holding
the prepuce, &amp;c. is seen in the cut.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">

  </div>
</div>

<p>On the under side of the glans, near the mouth of the
water passage, or urethra, the prepuce is attached by a
fold called the <i>frenum</i>, or bridle, or martingale of the penis.
The use of this frenum is to confine the movements
of the prepuce, and to draw down the mouth of the water
passage to direct the flow of the urine. Sometimes the
frenum is too short, and confines the prepuce too much;
it may be slit down with a pair of scissors as far as is
considered expedient. The frenum is frequently ruptured
in a first coition. The frenum is very elastic, and protects
the sensitive surface beneath it as the eyelid does the eye.
Sometimes, however, it becomes permanently contracted;—the
glans is then denuded, but soon loses its sensibility.
The person is sometimes born with this formation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>The <i>cavernous bodies</i> form two tubes, united in most of
the length of the penis, separated only by a thin partition,
and enveloped in a firm sheath; they are composed of an
immense number of cells, principally formed by dilated
veins, which communicate with each other; these, when
the penis is erected, become filled and even distended with
blood. The cavernous bodies terminate abruptly and form
rounded points under the glans penis. At the other extremity
they separate, and form the crura or legs of the
penis.</p>

<p>The <i>spongy body</i> forms the lower and under body of the
penis, terminates at one end at the point in the glans, whilst
it extends the whole length of the penis, again becomes
enlarged, and forms the <i>bulb</i>. The urethra or water passage
extends through the spongy body, and connects the
penis with the bladder. This cut is a section of the penis
showing the three bodies:</p>

<p>In the cut above we see the septum or division of the
cavernous bodies, in which are seen the vessels by which,
when the erection of the penis subsides, the blood passes
into the dorsal vein of the penis.</p>

<p>The <i>Urethra</i>, or water passage, is the canal that passes
through the spongy body to the bladder. The urine and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
semen pass through it. It is very elastic, and may be dilated
so as to admit a large instrument to be passed into
the bladder, and it contracts on the smallest. It is supported
in its course by the spongy body and the prostate
gland, between which is a portion unprotected, called the
membranous portion. The passage varies in its size in
different parts: thus it is rather contracted at the orifice,
enlarges within, and for an inch again contracts, dilates
nearer the bulb, diminishes at the membranous portion
and near the prostate gland, and finally enlarges into the
bladder. The cut opposite will show these parts.</p>

<p>The urethra is constantly moistened with a mucous secretion,—from
the membrane itself, the glands, and the
folds which yield to the pressure of the urine as it flows, or
from other altered conditions of the urethra pour out their
contents. The inner surface of the urethra is very vascular
and sensitive, as is shown by the slightest laceration
by the bougie or by chordee, when considerable bleeding
often takes place. Its sensitiveness is well known in the
first passing of the bougie, or in inflammation, when the
pain of the former and the act of urinating in the latter,
often causes fainting.</p>

<p>The bladder is the reservoir of the urine, which is formed
in the kidneys, comes into the ureters, passages leading
from the kidneys to the bladder, and thence flows, drop by
drop, into the bladder. The bladder is shaped somewhat
like a pear, but this shape is varied by its contents, and
the relative condition of its adjacent parts. Thus, when
the bladder is full, its upper part may be felt rising above
the pubis, that portion of the lower part of the belly that
is covered with hair. In very fat persons the bladder is
flattened by the weight of the intestines, and obliged to
find room where it can, as in pregnant women. Anatomists,
when describing the bladder, speak of its body, base,
or upper part, sides and neck, where the urethra or water
passage begins, and which is surrounded by the prostate
gland. These parts are seen in the first engraving on the
opposite page.</p>

<p>The bladder is composed of several coats. There is a
peculiar membrane investing the important structures in
the abdomen called the peritonœum. The base and back
part of the bladder is covered by a portion of this peritonœum,
which in a measure supports the bladder in its position,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
and also exercises certain properties which may
hereafter be alluded to.</p>

<p>A brief description of the structures displayed in the
two preceding and the following drawing (p. 14) will render
this part of our subject perfect.</p>

<p>The <i>Fasciæ</i> means the coverings of muscles, such as is
seen in cutting a domestic joint—a leg of mutton, for instance—a
shiny surface; their use is to strengthen the action
of the muscles, to bind them well together, and they
mostly exist about the buttocks, back, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The office of a Sphincter Muscle, of which we have
several, as that of the bladder and anus, is to keep closed
the aperture they surround. The sphincter ani closes the
rectum, and pulls down the bulb of the urethra, by which
it assists in ejecting the urine and semen.</p>

<p>The Levator Muscles lift up the part they are connected
with. The levator ani muscles form the funnel appearance
of the rectum, and help to draw it up after the fæces or
stools are evacuated. They also assist in sustaining the
contents of the pelvis, and help to eject the semen and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
urine, and contents of the rectum, and, perhaps, by pressing
upon the veins, contribute to the erection of the
penis.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p><i>Testicles.</i>—The testicles are two glandular oval bodies
suspended in the scrotum. They furnish the male seed.
They are supported by what is called the Spermatic Chord,
which consists of the spermatic artery that supplies the
testicle with arterial blood, whence the semen is concocted;
the veins that return the superfluous blood, and the tube
that conveys the semen to the urethra. The testicles are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
very liable to inflammation, and particularly to changes
resulting from the wear and tear of human life—changes
that not simply produce pain or inconvenience, but those
whereby the power of the organs becomes partially if not
wholly lost. A rather ample description of their complicated
structure will show the necessity of attending to the
earliest symptoms of disturbance. The testicles, in embryo,
are lodged in the belly, but they gradually descend,
and usually are found in the scrotum at birth. There are
occasional exceptions, when one or even both testicles do
not descend, but are retained in the groin. Mr. Hunter
considered that their virility was thereby impaired, although
such an opinion is negatived by numerous illustrations.
The non-descent of the testicle, necessarily from
its confined situation when in the groin, can not be so fully
developed as where it is allowed to range in the scrotum.
It is also exposed to accidents when retained, and cases
have occurred where Hydrocele, a disease to be noticed
hereafter, has ensued, producing much inconvenience,
and occasionally the same has been mistaken for rupture.
The testicles have several coats. The Scrotum
should be considered as one, which is merely a continuation
of the common integuments, exceedingly elastic, nearly
destitute of fat, and possessing a peculiar contractile
power of its own, whereby it can closely embrace the testicles,
and at other times yield or become distended, as in
hernia or hydrocele, to the size of a melon. The contractile
powers of the scrotum have been assigned to the
supposed presence of a muscle, which is merely a thickened
cellular membrane, and called Dartos. It was stated
that the testicles were suspended by their spermatic
chords—their support is rendered more perfect by the presence
of a muscle to each, that descends into the scrotum,
and which is called the Cremaster—it is an expansion
of one of the muscles of the abdomen, called the internal
oblique, and it spreads itself umbrella fashion
around the chord, over the upper part of the testicle, and
its fibres extend ray-like over the other coats of the testicle—its
office is to draw up the seminal organs during procreation.</p>

<p>The testicles, thus suspended, have two coats, one adhering
closely, and the other loosely surrounding the former—between
the two, a lubricating fluid is secreted,
whereby the various movements of the body are permitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
without injury; it is between these coats that water is
secreted occasionally, constituting the disease known as
hydrocele. The closely fitting coat is termed from its
whiteness and density Tunica Albuginea—the other Tunica
Vaginalis. These coverings are formed of that extensive
membrane in the abdomen called the Peritonœum.
The Tunica Albuginea which surrounds the testicle
previous to its descent, accompanies it into the
scrotum, propelling, as it were, the Tunica Vaginalis before
it. On the descent of the testicles into the scrotum,
the opening through which they passed becomes impermeably
closed.</p>

<p>The annexed diagram will explain the coats and facilitate
the understanding of subsequent descriptions.</p>

<p>When the coats of the testicle are taken off, it is found
to consist of innumerable delicate white tubes, which when
disengaged from the cellular membrane that connects them
together, and steeped in water, exhibit a most astonishing
length of convoluted vessels; they appear to consist of
one continuous tube, convoluted in partitions of the cellular
membrane. When the <i>Tubuli</i> come out from the
body of the testicle, they run along the back of it and
form a net work of vessels called Rete Testis; it is supposed
that by the net work the semen is conveyed from
the testicle. The continuations of this <i>Rete Testis</i> have
been denominated <i>Vasa Deferentia</i>, which, ending in a
number of <i>Vascular Cones</i>, constitute what is called the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Epididymis. The <i>Vasa Deferentia</i>, after forming three
conical convolutions, unite and form larger tubes, which
ultimately end in one large excretory duct, called the
Vas Deferens. The following description relates to the
accompanying sketch.</p>

<p>The preceding completes the anatomical description of
the Testicle. The semen is supposed to be secreted by
the arteries that ramify among the seminal tubes; the last
drawing exhibits the testicle as from the hand of the dissector.
In life and in health the epididymis is attached to
the testicle—the vas deferens passes up the chord, enters
the abdomen, and, passing down into the pelvis, terminates
in the vesiculæ seminales as already, but to be
again, alluded to. The two subjoined drawings illustrate the testicles in their natural situation.</p>

<p>The Vesiculæ Seminales appear like two cellular bags.
They have two coats, the one called nervous, and the inner
the cellular, a membrane divided into folds or ridges.
The use of the vesiculæ is supposed to be, to act as reservoirs
for the semen; but there are different opinions upon
the subject, some contending that they furnish a fluid, not
spermatic, but merely as an addenda to the seminal secretion;
whereas others, who have examined the vesiculæ of
persons who have suddenly died, have discovered all the
essential qualities of the male seed therein; and, in fact,
physiologists, who direct researches in these matters, advise
such examinations as the surest means of obtaining,
in a state of purity, the seminal fluid.</p>

<p>The Male Semen is a fluid of a <i>starch-ish</i> consistency
and of a whitish color. It has a peculiar odor, “like that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
of a bone while being filed—of a styptic and rather acrid
taste,” (for physiologists use more senses than one in these
researches), “and of greater specific gravity than any other
fluid of the body.” Shortly after its escape, “it becomes
liquid and translucent;” if suffered to evaporate, it
dries into scurfy-looking substance. By being examined
through a powerful microscope it is ascertained to be animated
by an infinite number of animalcules; but they are
only present in healthy semen, and consequently that fact
is taken as a criterion of the virility of the secretion.</p>

<p>President Wagner thus describes the germe of future animal
life: “The seminal granules are colorless bodies with
dark outlines, round and somewhat flattened in shape, and
measuring from 1-300 to 1-500th of a line in diameter.”
“The animalcules exist in the semen of all animals capable
of procreation. They are diversified in form in all animals
according to their species, but in man they are extremely
small, scarcely surpassing the 1-50th, or almost
the 1-40th of a line in breadth. This transparent and
flattened body seldom exceeds from the 1-6th to the 1-800th
of a line in length.”</p>

<p>The annexed drawing exhibits the granules and animalcules
of a human male being magnified from 900 to
1,000 <span class="nobreak">times:—</span></p>

<p>The semen is never discharged pure; it is always diluted
with the secretion from the prostate and other glands,
and also the mucus of the urethra. A chymical analysis
is thus given of 100 parts:</p>

<p>The semen may certainly be vitiated and diseased: the
odor and color assume all the gradations of other secretions
when in a morbid condition.</p>

<p>Semen not discharged is supposed to be absorbed, thereby
adding to the strength and nutriment of the economy;
but as it is furnished for a specific purpose, and its secretion
depends much upon the play of our animal passions,
and as they are rarely permanently idle, there is not only
the inducement that the fluid be furnished, but also emitted,
and hence we have nocturnal emissions. These, to a
degree, are salutary; but they may happen so frequently
that the function becomes disordered and perverted, and in
some individuals the semen (unconsciously to them) escapes
during sleep, or on the slightest local excitement of
riding, walking, or on the action of the bladder or rectum.</p>

<p>The prostate gland, as has been stated, contributes
much to the dilution of the semen; it may empty itself
independently of it. The gland is composed of numerous
cells, from which proceed some twenty or thirty pipes or
passages that open in the urethra by the sides of the verumontanum,
as shown in the drawing.</p>

<p class="noindent center brhide p1">———&lt;&gt;———</p>
<div class="section"></div>

<p><i>Morbid Secretions and Irritability of the Urethra.</i>—I
have stated that clap or gonorrhœa is one of the first and
most frequent complaints of the generative apparatus.
There are many secretions common to the urethra, such
as those afforded by the various glands for the purpose of
lubrication, &amp;c.; and the lining membrane of the passage
yields a moisture for its own protection, like the membrane
of many other organs, such as the eyes, nose, mouth,
and so forth, and these secretions may become unhealthy
or vitiated, and give rise to symptoms that lead on to confirmed
disease; and, what is still more remarkable, may
assume many of the characters and appearances of gonorrhœa,
but they rarely induce such constitutional disturbances
as clap. The symptoms, consequences, and duration
of clap, form its distinguishing features from any
other discharge of the urethra: it is very important that
such distinction should be understood, for the treatment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
of the two affections differs most materially; the one is
an affection of weakness, and the other of an inflammatory
and pestilential nature. The symptoms of clap are as
follow: there is usually first felt an uneasy sensation at
the mouth of the passage or urethra. The patient is
frequently called upon to arrange his person; that uneasy
sensation sometimes amounts to an itching (occasionally
of a pleasurable kind) the feeling extends a little way up
the penis; there is oftentimes an erection and a desire for
intercourse, which, if indulged in, the sooner develops
the disease. The itching alone will not convey the disease
from one person to another; but if intercourse be
held, the action of the inflamed vessels is accelerated, and
a purulent secretion which is infectious is urged forth and
emitted with the semen: therefore the very symptom of
the tingling or itching, for it rarely exists in healthy urethræ,
should be noticed, and intercourse be avoided until
it shall have ceased.</p>

<p>About this time is perceived a slight heat on passing
water, or at the conclusion of the act; and shortly after,
or may be before, a yellowish discharge is observed oozing
from the mouth of the glans or nut of the penis; the
symptoms then rapidly advance, unless timely and judicious
means be adopted to palliate them or effect a cure;
the scalding becomes intense, and the pain and smarting
continue some time after each operation of passing water:
the discharge becomes profuse and clots on the linen, and
continues to ooze out with little intermission: the orifice
of the urethra looks red and inflamed, and the glans itself
swells and is occasionally extremely tender: the foreskin
or prepuce sometimes, but fortunately not always, becomes
swollen, and tightened over the
nut of the penis, from which it can
not be drawn back, constituting that
form of the disease known by the
name of phymosis. See drawing annexed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">

    <p class="caption ebhide"><a class="underline" href="images/i_b_021_cropped_258x400.jpg" rel="nofollow">View larger image</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When that is the case, other annoyances
ensue; the purulent matter
collects around the glans; excoriations,
ulcerations, and sometimes
warts, are the consequence; the whole
symptoms become thereby much aggravated.
It also happens that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
prepuce from inflammation assumes a dropsical appearance,
that is to say, the edges or point swell, and appear
like a bladder filled with water; thus, the size which the
penis then arrives at is enormous, and to the patient very
alarming; it usually, however, subsides in a day or two,
if rest and proper measures be employed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">

  </div>
</div>

<p>The glans
with some people, is always bare, and the foreskin drawn
up around it. Such a state may be
induced also by disease: in either
case, it may become so inflamed as
to resist any efforts to draw it over
the glans and, from the swelling
and consequent pressure on the penis,
a kind of ligature is created;
and instances have been known
where the most disastrous results
have ensued. The circulation of the
blood in the glans is checked; the
nut puts on a black appearance, and
if the ligature be not removed or divided,
mortification takes place, and
the tip or more of the penis sloughs off or dies away.
This state of the prepuce is called <i>paraphymosis</i>: it sometimes
happens to young lads, who, having an indicated
opening of the foreskin, endeavor
to uncover the glans: they succeed,
but are unable to pull the
prepuce back again. They either
take no further notice of it, or
else become frightened, but conceal
the accident they have committed:
in a few hours, the parts
become painful, swell, and all the
phenomena above detailed ensue.</p>

<p>The annexed diagram exhibits
the foreskin in a state of paraphymosis.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">

  </div>
</div>

<p>The next proceeding which will probably be induced,
will be an extension of the inflammation to the bladder:
the symptoms are a frequent desire to make water, and
occasionally ulceration of the membrane lining the bladder
follows, when a quantity of muco-purulent matter is
discharged, which, mingling with the urine gives it the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
appearance of whey. Now and then the bladder takes on
another form of disordered function: the patient will be
seized with <i>retention of urine</i>, that is, a total inability to
discharge his water, except by the aid of the catheter. A
new and most perplexing feature about this stage of the
proceeding is perceived: it is what is called <i>chordee</i>. The
existing irritation excites the penis to frequent erections,
which are of the most painful nature. The penis is bent
downward; the occasion is, the temporary agglutinization
of some of the cells of the <i>corpora cavernosa</i> through
inflammation, and the distension of the open ones by the
arterial blood, thereby putting the adherent cells on the
stretch, and so constituting the curve, and giving rise to
the pain. This symptom is frequently a very long and
troublesome attendant upon a severe clap; it is more annoying,
however, than absolutely painful, as it prevents
sleep, it being present chiefly at night-time when warm in
bed.</p>

<p>Occasionally the glands in the groin enlarge and are
somewhat painful; they sometimes, but very rarely swell
and break; they more frequently sympathise with the adjacent
irritation, and may be viewed as indications of the
amount of general disturbance present; as the patient gets
better the glands go down, leaving a slight or scarcely perceptible
hardness as it were to mark where they had been.
The most painful of all the attendant phenomenon of clap
is <i>swelled testicle</i>, or, as in medical phraseology it is called,
<i>Hernia humoralis</i>.</p>

<p>The first indication of the approach of the last-named
affection is a slight sense of fulness in the testicle, generally
the left first, although occasionally in the right, sometimes
one after the other, but rarely both together: a
smart twinge is now and then felt in the back upon making
any particular movement: the testicle becomes sensibly
larger and more painful, the chord swells also and feels
like a hardened cord in the groin: the patient is soon incapacitated
from walking, or walks very lame; if the inflammation
be not subdued by some means, and if the patient
be of a “burning temperament,” that is, of a very
inflammatory constitution, fever is soon set up, and the patient
is laid upon a “sick bed.” There is no form of the
complaint so dangerous to neglect as swelled testicles;
they have sometimes been known to burst or become permanently
callous and hardened, and ever after wholly unfit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
for procreative purposes: in other instances, they have
entirely disappeared by absorption: in fact, all diseases
of the testicles interfere with the generative power. At
the onset of inflammation there may be a brief increase
of sexual appetite, but when the structure of the testicle
becomes altered or impaired, that appetite is subdued or
wholly lost; there is such a wonderful sympathy betwixt
all parts of the generative economy of man, that if one
portion only be injured, the ordinary end of sexual union
is frustrated.</p>

<p>The gonorrhœal poison is capable of producing a similar
discharge from other parts to which it may be applied
besides the urethra. It has been conveyed by means of
the finger or towel to the eyes and nose; and a purulent
secretion (attended with much pain and inconvenience,
indeed with great danger, when the eye becomes so attacked),
has oozed plentifully therefrom. Gonorrhœa is
an infectious disorder, and consequently is communicable
by whatever means the virus be applied. It certainly is
possible, and (if we are to believe the assertions of patients,
who are often met with, declaring they have not
held female intercourse, and yet have contracted the disease),
it certainly is not improbable that it may be taken
up from using a water-closet that has been visited by an
infectious person just before. It may also be contracted
by using a foul bougie.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">

  </div>
</div>

<p>If the gonorrhœal discharge be suffered to remain on
particular parts of the person, such as around the glans
of the penis, or on the outside of the foreskin, excoriations,
chaps, and warts, spring up speedily and plentifully,
and protrude before the prepuce, or
sometimes become adherent to it, as
here drawn: it therefore only shows
how necessary cleanliness is in these
disagreeable complaints, to escape the
vexations alluded to. A species of insect
also is apt to appear about the
hairy part of the genital organs, and
indeed extend all over the body, particularly
in those parts where hair grows,
such as under the armpits, chest, head,
&amp;c., if cleanliness be not observed. They are called crabs.
The itching they give rise to is very harassing, and the
patient, unable to withstand scratching, rubs the parts unto<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
sores, which, in
healing, exude little
crusts that break off
and bleed.</p>

<p>When the gonorrhœa has
been severe and
there has been much
constitutional disturbance,
there frequently
hang about what are called flying rheumatic pains;
and sometimes, if the patient’s health be much broken
up, confirmed rheumatism seizes hold of him, and wearies
him out of several months of his existence. I have
seen many a fine constitution, by a tedious ill-treated or
neglected gonorrhœa, much injured, that, had the sufferer
consulted a medical man of even ordinary talent, in the
first instance, instead of foolishly leaving the disease to
wear itself out with the help of <i>this</i> recommended by one,
and <i>that</i> by the other, he might have shaken off the hydra,
and have averted the hundred vexations that follow.</p>

<p>I come now to add to the list of calamitous consequences,
stricture, which, in my opinion, prevails to an enormous
extent; however, its consideration will be reserved,
as well as the affections of the bladder, and prostate gland,
for their proper places. I will simply repeat my impression
that a stricture, or narrowing of the urethra, or some
organic changes, invariably ensue when the gonorrhœa
has been mismanaged, or its cure unfortunately protracted.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of many medical men, and it can, no
doubt, be borne out by many patients, that a gonorrhœa
if unattended by any untoward circumstance, will wear itself
out, and that the duration of such a proceeding is
from one to two months; there is no disputing but such
has been, and is now and then the case, but such rarely
stand even so fair a chance of recovery as to be left entirely
alone: even if medicine be not taken, rest, abstemiousness,
and such like means, are seldom followed up;
either the patient lives gloriously free, or else goes to the
opposite extreme.</p>

<p>The cases of gleet which seek medical relief are more
numerous, as most professional men must be aware, than
those of gonorrhœa, for the reasons so frequently alluded
to; the fair inference would be, that a gonorrhœa seldom
escapes the terminus of a gleet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>The distinguishing feature of gleet from gonorrhœa is
that it is not considered infectious: it consists of a discharge
ever varying in color and consistence; it is the
most troublesome of all urethric derangements, and doubtlessly
helps more to disorganize the delicate mucous membrane
lining the urinary passage than even the severest
clap. Its action is constant though slow; and subject
as we are to alternations of health, of which even the urinary
apparatus partakes, it is not to be wondered at that
a part of our system which is so frequently being employed,
should become disturbed at last, and that stricture
and all its horrors should form a finale; but as gleet and
stricture form in themselves such important diseases, I
shall devote a chapter to the consideration of each separately.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p><i>The Surgical Treatment of Gonorrhœa.</i>—The principal
symptoms indicative of the outbreak of a gonorrhœa are
a scalding burning sensation along the urethra as the urine
passes through it, and also the pouring forth of a profuse
discharge of yellow matter from the same passage. The
urethra is lined with a very sensitive membrane, fashioned,
however, to be insensible to the urine in its natural state;
but if the character of the urine or the membrane itself
be altered, the most exquisite misery is produced. Now
in gonorrhœa, when it is a first attack, the initiatory sensation
is invariably heat, itching, or pain in the urethra;
the seat of this suffering is in the mucous membrane. On
separating the lips of the orifice of the urethra, the passage
appears highly vascular, very red, and looks, according
to the popular notion, very sore. On examining it
with a powerful glass, little streaks or surfaces of a yellow
and tenacious matter are perceived, which, upon being
removed, are soon replaced by others. When the patient
attempts to urinate, this purulent exudation becomes
washed off. By this time, the system is somewhat excited,
and the urine is consequently more deeply impregnated
with uric acid, which renders it more acrid and pungent
to the delicate and now tender outlet through which
it flows: the sensation is faint at first, but is rendered
very acute by the combined worry inflicted upon the urethra,
by its muscular contraction to eject every drop of
urine, the denuded state of the membrane itself, and the
irritating quality of the water. Such, however, is the
habit of action, that the urethra in course of time becomes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
indifferent to the annoyance of the flow of urine. The
nervous sensibility is much diminished, and the urethra is
further protected by an abundance of the venereal secretion.
There are numerous contingencies that prevent the
changes ensuing in such order, and, consequently, the
scalding, and the amount of discharge, are seldom two
days alike. Were there to be no interruption, the inflammation,
for such is the whole process in obedience to the
animal law, would fulfil its intention and retire; but molested
as it is by diet, exercise, the varied states of health,
and numerous other fortuitous circumstances, as we well
know, it exists indefinitely. It would be next to an impossibility
to explain the process whereby the character
of a secretion becomes altered, or to describe the exact
changes which the structure or vessels undergo when furnishing
the discharge; but we well know that some such
changes do take place, and that a cause must precede an
effect. In like manner we can ascertain the result of certain
experiments, although the <i>modus operandi</i> may baffle
our penetration. Gonorrhœa is originally a local complaint,
but if not arrested, it involves not only the neighboring
parts, but it compromises the general health. Now
if the same ends can be brought about by artificial means
in a few days, that it takes weeks to effect in the ordinary
routine, all the intermediate suffering may be avoided, and
all the inconvenience of confinement and physic-taking
spared.</p>

<p>To cure this disease I find that in many cases, if the
parties apply at the very onset of the disease, before the
discharge and scalding have set in with anything like severity,
and they themselves be not of a very inflammatory
temperament, that a sharp stimulating injection will at
once subdue the sensitiveness of the urethra and alter the
action, and, at the cost of very little, and that only temporary
suffering, effect a speedy cure: the mode, except it
be by stimulating the relaxed vessels, or owing to the specific
action of the injection, is, like all other medical operations,
a mystery. A favorite prescription is the nitrate
of silver, say one scruple of the nitrate to the ounce of
water, but the disease must be thus treated at the very
first symptom: the patient must be otherwise in comparatively
good health, and his occupation must not expose
him to much bodily fatigue. He must not be given to intemperance,
nor should those instances be selected where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the sufferer is of a very inflammatory constitution. Experience
begets confidence, and confidence begets experience.
In cautious hands I am satisfied of its usefulness;
but there are cases that turn out failures. I have used
the injection when the disease itself was a week old, and
with like success; but I am ready to confess I have known
cases, the cure of which were retarded by its employment.
The inflammation has been temporarily aggravated,
but they were cases where the treatment was not appropriate;
the disease was far advanced, there was much
heat and swelling, and the patient’s health was in most instances
considerably affected; but yet beyond the few
hours’ of suffering merely, no extraordinary symptoms
were produced. The cure was very shortly after effected
by means which I shall presently allude to.</p>

<p>In all cases of suspicious connexion I recommend copious
ablution as soon as possible.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The syringes I would
advise to be used should have their points conically shelved
off pear fashion; they fill up the urethra like a wedge,
and prevent the immediate escape of the injection: all injections
should be retained a few seconds, and then be allowed
to flow out. It is seldom worth while to repeat the
operation more than twice on an occasion; but that occasion
may be resorted to two or three times a day.</p>

<p>When the nitrate of silver is used, the syringe had better
be made of glass. The nitrate of silver discolors the
skin, linen, &amp;c.; therefore gloves should be worn, and
care taken that the fluid be not spilt over the person or
dress, but should the skin be stained, it can be removed
by a strong solution of hydriodate of potash.</p>

<p>The plan of injection, I must remind the reader, is only
applicable in early and old cases. The recent cases, as I
have before stated, are less frequently before the medical
man than what we may call a “ripe” gonorrhœa. The
old cases present also some difference as to the cause of
their continuance, and require also some difference in
their treatment, and they will be introduced under the
chapter headed “Gleet.”</p>

<p>The symptoms of a clap, fully developed, are severe
scalding, voluminous discharge, painful erections, local inflammation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
probably phymosis or paraphymosis, glandular
swellings, and possibly swelled testicle.</p>

<p>But all cases of gonorrhœa are not ushered in with
such severity; nor do many, if common cleanliness and
quiet only be maintained, experience even the various accompaniments
just described, and still fewer would if the
following precautions and measures were used.</p>

<p>The plan just laid down, may be called the surgical
treatment of gonorrhœa; the following may be designated
the <i>Medical</i>. This is divided into two methods—the one
denominated the Antiphlogistic, the other Specific. The
<i>Antiphlogistic</i> is a term applied to medicines, plans of diet,
and other circumstances, that tend to oppose inflammation
by a diminution of the activity of the <i>vital powers</i>, whereby
the inflammation is subdued, and nature rights herself
again of her own accord. The <i>Specific</i> implies a reliance
upon a particular remedy, which is supposed at once to set
about curing the disease, as, for instance, by giving Bark
in Ague—Colchicum in Rheumatism—Cubebs or Copaiba
in Gonorrhœa.</p>

<p>Now, both these plans are successful in curing gonorrhœa;
but the majority of medical men adopt the former
method, inasmuch as although it but <i>quietly</i> conducts the
case to a successful termination, still it <i>does so</i>, whereas
the specific, in unskilful hands, is often productive of many
annoyances, much delay, and not always a cure.</p>

<p>Our plan, however, is as follows: in the first place, I
take into consideration the appearance of the patient; if
he be strong, robust, sanguine, or of full habit, and youthful—if
it be his first attack, and if the symptoms be ushered
in with any degree of severity, I invariably and rigidly
(where I choose not the surgical) pursue the antiphlogistic
course of treatment; if the case be in a person of
phlegmatic temperament, of mature age, and the disease
be but a repetition of the past, and there be no evidence
of physical excitement, I fearlessly adopt the specific.
Where, in the third place, I encounter a patient with no
very prominent peculiarity, nor with symptoms demanding
extraordinarily active measures, experience has taught
me the propriety of cautiously combining the two methods—a
mild aperient had best always a precede a tonic or
a stimulant, in cases where there is a doubt of inflammation
lurking in the system; and, recollecting the tendency
our complicated organization has, when assailed by a distemper,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
to become irritable, it is always as important to
know when to withhold a remedy as when to prescribe one.</p>

<p>The three following imaginary cases will serve as no
inapt illustration of the principles laid <span class="nobreak">down:—</span></p>

<p class="smalltext-para">A. B. A man twenty-six years of age, five feet six inches in height,
weighing eleven stone six pounds, of a full rounded form—florid
complexion, of what is termed a sanguine temperament, and harassed
with the following symptoms: profuse discharge in large yellow clotted
lumps of gonorrhœal virus—intolerable scalding on passing water—great
pain at the rectum at the close of micturition—redness and swelling of
the orifice of the glans penis, puffiness of the prepuce, a <i>vicious</i>
chordee—inclination to headache—a bounding pulse—hot skin, and an
anxious mind. Treatment: say first bleeding, then purging; warm
bath, saline powders or mixtures, cold lotions to the part, rest,
abstinence; the following eve, symptoms will be less severe. Continue
the powders, temperance and quiet. In a few days, the discharge will
be lessened, the scalding mitigated, the chordee gone, and the fever
exchanged for the cool skin of health. The resuscitative powers of
nature await only the fillip of some gentle stimulant, and the sick
man throws off his mantle for the coronal of health.</p>

<p class="smalltext-para">B. C. At twenty-three, dark countenance, marked features, well
developed muscular form, pulse 66, bilious temperament, accustomed
to late hours, hard drinking, and seldom still, and <i>subject</i> to
clap. Symptoms: plenteous discharge with but little scalding, and
no inconvenience beyond the suspension of ordinary sensualities.
Treatment: cleanliness, cubebs or copaiba, injections, a black
draught, and half a dozen days’ rest, release him from his quarantine.</p>

<p class="smalltext-last-para">C. D. At nineteen, a timid bashful youth, for the first time infected
with gonorrhœa, which he had enduringly borne for the last fortnight,
having neglected until now to seek professional aid, although cajoled
into the purchase and imbibing of some popular “never-failing
antidote” for a “certain disease.” Symptoms: discharge <i>cured</i>? right
testicle swollen, and treble the size of the other, and excruciatingly
painful; frequent desire to pass water, pain in the groin and back,
general lassitude, and a feeling of illness all over. Treatment:
leeches, warm bath, bed, purging, fever medicines, cold lotions, hot
fomentations, low diet and patience, a month’s imprisonment, and a
slow recovery. Had the treatment of the first two cases been reversed,
the results would have been very different: and had the last sought
timely and efficient aid, he would have been spared much that he
endured.</p>

<p>However, to particularize the treatment for each symptom;
to commence, I will request the reader to remember
that on the first appearance of gonorrhœa, attended with
an unusual inflammatory aspect, I practise, where permissible,
venesection; if the case demand it not, at least
there should be administered an aperient; let, therefore,
a dose of opening medicine be taken immediately (Form <a id="FManchor_1"></a><a href="#Form_1" class="fmanchor">1</a>).
This is the first step toward reducing inflammatory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
action—the next should be directed toward allaying the
local symptoms, by diminishing the nervous irritability of
the urethric passage.</p>

<p>With this view, no plan surpasses that of bathing the
penis in warm water, or immersing the entire body in a
warm bath. The former should be repeated several times
in the day; the latter daily, or certainly on alternate days,
so long as the severity lasts.</p>

<p>By these means, the parts will be preserved clean, and
will derive benefit from the soothing influence of warmth;
and, in many cases, this will be the means of averting
chordee or swelled testicle.</p>

<p>Where, however, from peculiar circumstances, warm
water and warm baths are not to be had, the penis should
be bathed in <i>cold</i> water, or encircled with pledgets of rags
or lint, moistened with cold goulard or rose-water. Warm,
however, is to be preferred, although cold water seldom
fails of affording relief.</p>

<p>To lessen the acrimony of the urine, which keeps up
the irritability, and somewhat to lower the system, all
strong drinks, such as ale, beer, wine, and spirits, should
be avoided, and milk, tea, barley-water, toast and water,
linseed tea, gum arabic in solution, and other such mucilaginous
diluting liquors taken instead. The diet should
be lowered: in fact, a spare regimen should be adopted,
not wholly abstaining from animal food, but partaking of
it only once in the day, and carefully excluding all salted
meats, rich dishes, soups, gravies, &amp;c. The usual employment
should be suspended, and rest should be taken as
much as possible in a recumbent posture.</p>

<p>Of course the preceding remarks apply only to cases
of severity; I mean such cases as first attacks ordinarily
prove; and which remarks, if attended to, will greatly
mitigate the violence of the disease.</p>

<p>To assist the foregoing treatment, the aperient medicine,
which should be repeated, at least, on alternate
days, until the inflammation is ameliorated, should be followed
by some saline or demulcent medicine to allay the
general disturbance. Several formulæ are suggested for
that purpose, suitable to various temperaments and conditions—[<i>See Forms</i>
<a id="FManchor_2"></a><a href="#Form_2" class="fmanchor">2</a>,
<a id="FManchor_3"></a><a href="#Form_3" class="fmanchor">3</a>,
<a id="FManchor_4"></a><a href="#Form_4" class="fmanchor">4</a>,
<a id="FManchor_5"></a><a href="#Form_5" class="fmanchor">5</a> <i>in Formulæ annex</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>
<p>By these means, the disease, if not aggravated by intemperance
of living, or otherwise, will gradually subside,
and in the course of a fortnight or three weeks, cease
entirely, without the aid of any other remedy whatever.</p>

<p>But we need not rest satisfied with merely “showing”
the disease through its stages; we can expedite it, and
many of its steps we can skip over, and here it is we may
call to our aid the specific method of treatment alluded
to. This specific method consists of the suspension of a
vitiated secretion, and a restoration of a healthy one.
Now how this is effected we know not; we only know
that it can be done—and experience has taught us that it
may be done safer at one time than another. During the
existence of a fevered state of the circulation, it would
be highly impolitic suddenly to check a discharge from
any surface, much less one situated like the mucous membrane
of the urethra, in the immediate connexion, as it
is, of important nerves and glandular structures—a metastasis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
of the inflammation will almost invariably ensue;
and hence we account for swollen testicles, buboes, painful
affections of the bladder, &amp;c. Whereas, on the subsidence
of inflammation, the revulsion is borne; and to our
satisfaction, the disease disappears. A constitution in a
state of excitement is like a fretted child—it will have its
“will” out, and the rod is not always the safest corrective.</p>

<p>On the subsidence, therefore, of the scalding, and a lessening
of the general fever, the specific plan of treatment
may be commenced. Upon the same principle that
the surgical treatment is selected according to the symptoms,
so also are the just-named preliminaries in many
cases dispensable, and hence, as hereafter detailed, it will
be found that the antiphlogistic and specific do not go
always hand in hand. However, to explain the <span class="nobreak">latter:—</span></p>

<p>By specifics are meant those remedies that exert a positive
curative effect on a particular disease; and the most
prominent of those, in gonorrhœa, are copaiba and cubebs.
See Formulæ annex for some useful recipes of both—Forms
<a id="FManchor_6"></a><a href="#Form_6" class="fmanchor">6</a>,
<a id="FManchor_7"></a><a href="#Form_7" class="fmanchor">7</a>,
<a id="FManchor_8"></a><a href="#Form_8" class="fmanchor">8</a>,
<a id="FManchor_9"></a><a href="#Form_9" class="fmanchor">9</a>,
<a id="FManchor_10"></a><a href="#Form_10" class="fmanchor">10</a>.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>For instance, cubebs may be taken alone, in water, in
doses of a tablespoonful twice or thrice daily. If cubebs
produce no good effect in four or five days, it had better
be discontinued, and other means sought after.</p>

<p>These proceedings usually carry the disease to a close,
and, if no adventitious circumstances occur, successfully
and speedily. It is well to deserve success, but it can not
be always commanded.</p>

<p>The business engagements of young men render it almost
impossible for them to devote that care and attention
so importantly requisite; and few, consequently, will be
found who will be fortunate enough to escape the usual
concomitants of a gonorrhœa.</p>

<p>Where, therefore, the scalding or passing the urine is
very severe, the pain may be mitigated by carefully injecting,
previously to making water, either of the formulæ
No. <a id="FManchor_11"></a><a href="#Form_11" class="fmanchor">11</a> or
No. <a id="FManchor_12"></a><a href="#Form_12" class="fmanchor">12</a>
(see Formulæ annex) into the urethra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>The inflammation extends in general not more than two
inches down that passage, so that much force is not required
to inject the intended fluid, nor should an unnecessary
quantity be used.</p>

<p>When the inflammation reaches the bladder—which is
indicated by pain in that viscus and the perinœum, with
a constant desire to pass water—the taking of a warm
bath at a temperature of 100°, and remaining therein for
a quarter of an hour, will afford essential relief.</p>

<p>When a chordee is attendant on a gonorrhœa, and the
patient can not sleep, the draught (Form <a id="FManchor_13"></a><a href="#Form_13" class="fmanchor">13</a>) may be taken
on going to bed, or the powder (Form <a id="FManchor_14"></a><a href="#Form_14" class="fmanchor">14</a>) in some gruel.
The embrocation (Form <a id="FManchor_15"></a><a href="#Form_15" class="fmanchor">15</a>) rubbed on the parts affected,
however, will instantly remove both the pain and the
spasmodic contraction, and not unfrequently prevent their
recurrence. Care must be taken that the embrocation be
only used for its specific purpose, and not swallowed by
mistake, as it is poisonous.</p>

<p>In the event of the patient being obliged to follow his
ordinary occupation, or to go about, the use of a suspensory
bandage will be found of great benefit; indeed it is
indispensable, and the neglect of it has often brought on
swelled testicle, or most excruciating chordee.</p>

<p>By way of recapitulation, the treatment of gonorrhœa
thus far consists: in severe cases, of bleeding; in ordinary
ones, and in both, of warm bathing, local or general—where
impracticable, cold—attention to diet, the taking
of aperient, soothing and astringent medicines, rest as
much as possible, and the use of the suspensory bandage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
These remarks are equally applicable, then, through every
stage of this complaint that is accompanied by inflammation,
and may be relied upon as the most effectual to
avert all the consequences I now proceed to detail.</p>

<p>The consideration of the symptoms here following is
not in the order in which they always occur; for swelled
testicle may ensue without phymosis or paraphymosis preceding,
or even being present; and the converse holds
equally good with regard to every other.</p>

<p>The successful treatment of phymosis (that condition of
the foreskin in which it can not be drawn back over the
glans) depends very much upon local management. Bathing
the part frequently in warm water, the daily use of
the warm bath, and the frequent injection, by means of a
syringe, of warm milk and water, are generally all that is
required to reduce phymosis; but where it is attended
with much inflammation, where the glans is excoriated,
probably by the discharge from the urethra accumulating
between it and the prepuce, and thereby inducing irritation,
bleeding is even sometimes necessary, the strictest
antiphlogistic regimen should be preserved, and the treatment
advised in the early stages of gonorrhœa scrupulously
followed.</p>

<p>Sometimes the prepuce becomes so swollen as to assume
an œdematous or dropsical appearance; in which case it
may be scarified with a lancet, or several leeches applied.
With the exception of concealing the state of the glans,
phymosis is less dangerous than paraphymosis, and is
most usually produced by the patient worrying the part,
by frequently uncovering the glans to observe its condition.
Where a discharge is perceived oozing from beneath
the prepuce, which is not urethral, and the glans
does not feel sore or tender, the injection (Form <a id="FManchor_16"></a><a href="#Form_16" class="fmanchor">16</a>) syringed
up five or six times a day, will prove very efficacious
in healing the ulceration.</p>

<p>Where there is an unnatural elongation of the prepuce,
it will be constantly subject to phymosis, not only from
gonorrhœal inflammation, but from the accumulation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
the natural secretions of the part. In that case, cleanliness
is the only remedy the patient can employ of himself.
Occasionally it is necessary to have recourse to the surgeon’s
knife.</p>

<p>Paraphymosis is the opposite to phymosis, and usually
arises in this way: the orifice of the prepuce, being contracted
by the inflammation, is drawn back for the purpose
of washing or examination, and is allowed to remain,
or, as frequently happens, it can not be redrawn. When
this continues some time, considerable inflammation, both
of the glans and prepuce, arises. The contracted orifice
pressing more tightly, it will often happen that a sloughing
of both it and the glans will take place; but this occurs
only in consequence of neglect, or in constitutions
injured by intemperance.</p>

<p>If seen and attended to early, this state may be removed
very easily. The penis should be immersed in a basin of
cold water, or sponged, so as to cool it as much as possible;
or it may be well oiled. In either case there will
not be much difficulty in pressing up the glans and drawing
up the prepuce over it; but where adhesion has taken
place, or ulceration exists, it will be harder to accomplish:
the adhesions must be separated, or the stricture divided
with the scalpel.</p>

<p>I need scarcely observe, that such an operation is out
of the province of the non-professional person, who should
lose no time in consulting his surgeon.</p>

<p>I omitted to mention, in the description of the symptoms
of gonorrhœa, that occasionally, in very severe cases, a
tumor forms in the perinœum, which, if neglected, proceeds
to suppuration, and establishes a fistulous communication
with the urethra. On the instant of such a
swelling appearing, leeches, fomentations, and poultices,
should be applied with a view to disperse it; but the management
of such a case had better be intrusted to the surgeon.</p>

<p>Excoriation of the membrane of the glans or prepuce
requires for its treatment frequent ablution with warm
water until the redness and discharge somewhat diminish,
when Form <a href="#Form_16" class="fmanchor">16</a> may be resorted to, and applied, if practicable,
by a moistened layer of lint; but if accompanied by
phymosis, the syringe must be used.</p>

<p>Warts, if not large, are easily removed, by brushing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
them with the muriated tincture of iron, or the application
of a lotion of lunar caustic (Form <a id="FManchor_17"></a><a href="#Form_17" class="fmanchor">17</a>).</p>

<p>Where they are numerous and large, and resist the remedies
just recommended, the nitric acid is an excellent escharotic;
it gives little or no pain, and is rarely productive
of inflammation. The glans, if not naturally denuded
(in which instance, by the way, warts seldom accrue),
should be kept so for a time; and the nitric acid, after a
few moments, washed off with cold water. Notwithstanding,
excision is sometimes necessary to their complete removal.</p>

<p>When the organs of generation are infested by pediculi,
or crab-lice, the most efficacious and agreeable remedy is
the sulphur-bath; one bath generally effecting an extinction
of every one of them, even though they be all over
the body.</p>

<p>Some recommend shaving the hair off the pubis, the locality
in which the vermin are most usually engendered,
and applying blue ointment or the black wash. Such a
practice is seldom ineffectual, but the irritation attendant
upon the reproduction of hair is absolutely intolerable.
The hair need not be removed, as the above remedies will
be all-sufficient without it. Rubbing the parts well with
strong mercurial (or blue) ointment, or the black wash (Form <a id="FManchor_18"></a><a href="#Form_18" class="fmanchor">18</a>),
or even powdering them with calomel, will at once destroy
the insects, and thereby remove the itching.</p>

<p>Swelled testicle, or <i>hernia humoralis</i>, more especially
that proceeding from gonorrhœal irritation, is ushered in
and discovered in the following manner: The patient, on
some sudden movement of the body, experiences a pain,
darting from one of the <i>testes</i> (both being rarely affected
at the same time) to the loins—the left testicle is the one
generally attacked. On examination, he finds that the
testicle is rather swollen and full, and very painful on being
handled; the swelling quickly increases and becomes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
hard, which hardness extends to the spermatic chord, presenting
the feel of a rope, passing from the scrotum to the
groin.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that when swelled testicle occurs, the
discharge from the urethra, which, from previously being
very profuse, and the scalding on making water, which
was very severe, both suddenly diminish, or cease entirely,
until the inflammation of the <i>testis</i> declines; hence, it has
been supposed by some, that the disease is translated from
the urethra to the testicle.</p>

<p>It is more probably however, derived from the sympathy
between the two; the irritation of the one affecting
the other, and the preponderance of inflammation in the
testicle acting on the principle of counter-irritation to the
urethra, and, for a time, thereby lessening the disease in
it: for it is observed that, as soon as one improves, the
disease returns in the other. The treatment of <i>hernia humoralis</i>
must be strictly antiphlogistic. In no form of gonorrhœal
disease is bleeding more absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The timely and prompt loss of twelve or sixteen ounces
of blood from the arm will often cut short the complaint,
and render other remedies almost unnecessary; while the
temporising delay, under the vain hope of the inflammation
subsiding, will allow the disease to make rapid progress,
and impose a necessity of several weeks’ rest and
absence from business, before a cure can be effected.</p>

<p>Immediately, then, on the occurrence of swelled testicle, I would
recommend the patient to be bled—to take some aperient medicine,
and, if the inflammation continues, to apply from twelve to eighteen
leeches, and afterward suffer the wounds to bleed for twenty minutes
in a warm bath; to retire to bed or to the sofa, and to maintain a
horizontal posture. If he be strong, young, and robust,
an emetic (Form <a id="FManchor_19"></a><a href="#Form_19" class="fmanchor">19</a>)
may be given previous to the aperient, which has been known to remove
the swelling almost instantaneously.</p>

<p>Iodine (Form <a id="FManchor_20"></a><a href="#Form_20" class="fmanchor">20</a>)
also possesses a similar specific property in reducing
swelled testicle, and may be taken during the inflammatory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
stage after bleeding and aperients, as may likewise
the chlorate or hydriodate of potass (Form <a id="FManchor_21"></a><a href="#Form_21" class="fmanchor">21</a>).</p>

<p>With regard to local applications, the repeated employment of
leeches, fomentations, and poultices, with the frequent use of the warm
bath, and, above all, keeping the testicle constantly supported by
means of a bag, truss, or suspensory bandage, will subdue the disease
in a very short time, without impairing the functions of the important
organ concerned.</p>

<p>A hardness, however, of the <i>epididymis</i> commonly remains and
continues during life, but rarely gives rise to any inconvenience,
although this may often be remedied by compressing the testicles with
strips of adhesive plaster, as seen in the cut.</p>

<p>Almost every case of inflamed testicle will terminate favorably
by strictly pursuing the plan proposed; but when, from any untoward
circumstance, the inflammation proceeds to suppuration, the case must
be treated like one of common abscess, in which event professional aid
should be sought for without delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>Other diseases of the testicle will be treated upon under
a specific head.</p>

<p>To return to the treatment of Gonorrhœa:—On the
abatement of all or any of the enumerated symptoms, such
as the diminution of the scalding upon making water, the
subsidence of chordee, the escape from, or cure of, swelled
testicle, phymosis and paraphymosis, warts, crabs, excoriations,
&amp;c., the discharge may still continue, though
thicker in consistence, and deeper in color: and it is at
this period, which I will call chronic gonorrhœa, when
all inflammatory symptoms have left, that stimulants
may be judiciously given; but it must be borne in mind
that relapses often occur from imprudence: and this chronic
form requires as much attention as the acute or early
stage. (See <a href="#Gleet"><i>article Gleet</i></a>.)</p>

<p class="noindent center brhide p1">———&lt;&gt;———</p>
<div class="section"></div>

<p><a id="Gleet"></a><i>Gleet.</i>—Gleet is certainly, as its name implies, a discharge
of thin ichor from a sore. Patients usually understand,
and medical men usually allow, a gleet to be a discharge
from the urethra, which has existed some time, of a whitish
color, unattended with pain, and that is <i>not infectious</i>,
by which is meant is incapable of producing gonorrhœa.
There are several kinds of morbid secretions, the successful
treatment of which depends upon a knowledge of their
differences. They may be divided into two principal orders—those
secreted from the mucous surface of the urethra
or bladder, and those which proceed from the various
glands-leading into one or the other. Gleet is a term popularly
applied to both, but more strictly relates to that
which proceeds from the membrane lining the urinary canal.
There is great analogy in inflammatory affections
between the mucous membrane of the digestive and pulmonary,
as well as urinary passages. In inflammatory
sore throat, the secretions assume various appearances;
there is a discharge of viscid mucus, of purulent matter,
or of a thin watery nature; these secretions are
dependant upon the amount and duration of the inflammation
present. Exactly in like manner may be explained
those issuing from the urethra. They are consequently
alike modified by treatment, by diet, by rest, and
aggravated by a departure from constant care. It is the
nature of all membranes, lining canals that have external
outlets, to attempt the reparative process by pouring
forth discharges, while those which line the structures
that have not, effect their cure by union with the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
surface. It is an admirable provision, else important passages
might become closed, and so put a stop to vital processes;
and in the other case, accumulations ensue that
could not escape without occasioning serious mischief.
When, however, disease has existed a long time, the operation
of the two kinds of membranes is reversed. The
serous,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
through inflammation, take on the character of
abscess, dropsy, or other secretions, and the mucous ulcerate
or form adhesions, as evidenced in stricture, or ulceration
of the throat or urethra. Gleet may be a spontaneous
disease, that is to say, may arise from other causes
than infection. It may exist independently of gonorrhœa,
and be the result of cold, of intemperance, and of general
or of local excess. Its long continuance and neglect,
however, renders it infectious, and it also gives rise to ulceration,
excrescences, and stricture: and when, from other
causes, ulceration, or excrescences, or stricture, are set up,
gleet is in return generally one of their consequences.
Gleet, despite these various occasions, is, after all, most
frequently a remnant of gonorrhœa; and it is very difficult
to define the time or point where the one ends and
the other commences. Pathologists draw this distinction
between the two:—they say that gonorrhœal discharge
consists of <i>globules</i>, mixed with a <i>serous</i> fluid, while gleet
is merely a mucous secretion. I confess it difficult for a
non-professional person to decide which is which, the
resemblance, in fact, being so great—a gonorrhœal discharge
being one day thick and yellow, a few days afterward
thin and whitish, and at one time in quantity scanty,
and the next profuse. Gleet assumes nearly the same
changes. The best test for distinguishing them is, by regarding
the accompanying symptoms. Where there is
pain on passing water, bladder-irritability, tenderness in
the perinœum or neighboring parts, and the discharge
plentiful and offensive, staining the linen with a “foul
spot,” it may, without much fear, be decided to be clap;
but where the discharge is next to colorless, like gum-water,
for instance, and where there is no other local uneasiness
than a feeling of relaxation, and where it has existed
for a long period, and was, or was not, preceded by a
gonorrhœa, it may fairly be called a gleet. Now where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
does the discharge of gleet come from? Let us recapitulate
its causes; first from clap, which is a specific inflammatory
affection. It may therefore be a chronic inflammatory
state of the lining membrane of the urethra, of
greater or less extent; in which case we would call it
chronic gonorrhœa, and which would be owing to a relaxed
state of the secretive vessels. We know that when
a disease exists for a long while, and is one not positively
destructive to life, a habit of action is acquired that renders
its continuation in that state as natural as its healthy
condition. This is the state of the secretive vessels in
gleet, arising from gonorrhœa; and hence the discharge
is poured forth, instead of the secretion natural to the urethral
passage in its healthy order. Secondly, such may
have been the severity of a clap, that ulceration of some
portion of the urethra may have taken place. The disease
may have got well except in that identical spot which,
owing to the constant irritation occasioned by the urine
passing over it, struggles with the reparative intention
and effort of nature, and exists even for years. Thirdly,
when stricture is brewing, which will be explained in an
appropriate chapter, the alteration going on gives forth a
discharge, and, as I have stated in another part of this
work, I here repeat, that a long and obstinate gleet, as
the slightest examination would testify, rarely fails to indicate
the presence of a stricture. Lastly, gleet may be
produced by loss of tone in some or the whole portion of
the secretive vessels, induced by one or many of the accidents
of life, or the various kinds of physical intemperance
when they not only weep forth various kinds of fluids,
at irregular intervals, which impair the muscular and
nervous energy of the generative organ, but render persons
laboring under this description of weakness very susceptible
of infection, if they hold sexual contact with
those but slightly diseased. Hence persons laboring under
this form of debility incur what others escape. An
individual so circumstanced would receive a taint from a
female having leucorrhœa. Very many inconveniences
have arisen from this infirmity, giving birth occasionally
to unjust suspicions, and creating alarms of the most distressing
nature.</p>

<p>Thus, then, we may have gleet from gonorrhœa, gleet
from ulceration, gleet from stricture, gleet from debility
and discharges, popularly understood to be gleet, but in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
reality glandular secretions, which will be considered
shortly and separately. Gleet is a tiresome and troublesome
disorder. So difficult, occasionally, is its management,
that oftentimes the more regularly a patient lives,
and the more strictly he conforms to medical regimen, the
more deceptive is his disorder. He will apparently be
fast approaching to, as he conceives, a recovery, when,
without “rhyme or reason,” the complaint recurs, and
hints that his past forbearance has been thrown away. It
would be dispiriting, indeed, were every case of gleet to
realize this description; but it is well known that many
do, either from neglect or mismanagement. Now it must
be evident that the treatment of gleet depends upon what
may happen to be the occasion of it. Where the membrane
of the urethra is entire, internal remedies may, and
do avail. Copaiba will achieve wonders; the use also of
a mild injection, perseveringly employed (as a solution of
iodide of iron, or citrate of iron, ten grains to the ounce
of water), will give tone and stringency to the weakened
vessels, and so correct the quantity, at least, of the secretion.
In very obstinate cases, stronger injections, as of
the nitrate of silver, twenty grains to the ounce of water,
are serviceable; and we are not without many useful internal
medical combinations, which, properly administered,
conquer this troublesome complaint. In ulceration and
stricture, these two causes must be removed, else all efforts
are unavailing. In general and local debility, the attention
must be devoted to the constitution. Common
sense and common reading must give to persons, possessing
both, every necessary information. The community
are beginning to appreciate the advantages of temperance,
air, and exercise, too highly, to need instructions how
much of the one or either of the other two are essential
to the preservation or recovery of health.</p>

<p><i>Morbid Irritability of the Urethra.</i>—Of the varied symptomatic
sensations, few are more provoking and fretting
than some continued troublesome itching or pain that frequently
attends the passing of water. There may be no
discharge of any kind, but there is either a constant tingling,
partially pleasurable sensation, drawing the attention
perpetually to the urethra, or there is felt some particular
heat or pain during the act of micturition. These feelings
do not always indicate a venereal affection; they appear
to depend upon local irritation, perhaps induced by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
morbid condition of the urine. The treatment consists in
temperate diet, moderatively laxative medicines, and now
and then local applications. Some cases yield to sedatives
topically applied, and alkalies given internally, while others
need local stimulants and specific tonics. At all
events, whenever there is an unhealthy feeling in those
parts, it points out some altered action is going on, which,
if not arrested, is likely to end in stricture or gleet, and
therefore attention had better be bestowed upon it as soon
as possible.</p>

<p><i>On Stricture of the Urethra.</i>—Of all diseases of the genito-urinary
system, stricture must be allowed to be the
most formidable. It is not the most difficult to cure; but
it involves, when neglected, more serious disturbances—disturbances
which frequently compromise only with loss
of life. Stricture is a disease unfortunately of extensive
prevalence; and in nine cases out of ten is the sequence
of a gonorrhœa; and, what is still more comforting, few
persons who become the prey to the latter infliction escape
scot-free from the former; not because a clap <i>must</i> necessarily
be succeeded by a stricture, but simply because it <i>is</i>,
and all owing to the carelessness and inattention manifested
by most young men in the observances so necessary
for the perfect cure of the primary disease. One very
prevalent notion, and which explains a principal cause of
the extension of the venereal disease, is entertained, that
the way to give the finishing <i>coup</i> to an expiring clap, is
to repeat the act that gave rise to it: the disease becomes
temporarily aggravated, and the impatient invalid probably
flies, from an unwillingness to confess his new error,
from his own tried medical friend to some professional
stranger. From a desire to earn fame as well as profit,
the newly consulted prescribes some more powerful means;
the discharge is arrested for a while, but returns after the
next sexual intercourse; a strong injection subdues the
recurrent symptom, which only awaits a fresh excitement
for its reappearance. Thus a gleet is established. The
patient finding little or no inconvenience from the slight
oozing, which, as he observes, is sometimes better and occasionally
worse, according to his mode of living, determines
to let nature achieve her own cure, and for months
he drags with him a distemper that, despite all his philosophy,
he can not reflect on without an humiliating diminution
of self-approval. So insidiously, however, does the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
complaint worm its progress, that the patient, considering
his present state the worst that can befall him, resolves to
endure it, since it appears his own constitutional powers
are incapable of throwing it off.</p>

<p>In the midst of this contentment, the invalid finds that the process
of urinating engages more time than formerly, the urine appears to
flow in a smaller stream, and is accompanied by a sensation as though
there were some pressure “behind it.” The act of making water is not
performed so cleanly as it used to be; the stream differs in its flow,
seldom coming out full and free, but generally split into three or four
fountain-like spirts, as the annexed drawing displays.</p>

<p>At other times it twists into a spiral form, and then suddenly
splits into two or more streams, while at the same moment the urine
drops over the person or clothes, unless great care be observed, as
witness diagram.</p>

<p>In advanced cases, the urethra becoming so narrow the bladder has
not power to expel the urine forward, and it then falls upon the shoes
or trowsers, or between them, as observe illustration.</p>

<p>Persons afflicted with stricture, and urinating
in the streets, may almost be detected
from the singular attitude they are obliged
to assume to prevent the urine from inconveniencing
them, and also from the time occupied
in discharging it. Some few minutes
after making water, when dressed and proceeding on his
way, the patient finds his shirt become moist by some
drops of urine that continue to ooze from the penis; and
it is only as these annoyances accumulate, he begins to
think he is laboring under some other disease than the
gleet. The next symptom he will experience will be a
positive but temporary difficulty in passing his water—perhaps
a total inability to do so; it will, however, subside
in a few minutes. This will lead him to reflect, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
he will even appease his fears by inclining to think it may
be the consequence of his last night’s excess: he resolves
to be more careful for the future, and he gets better; his
contemplated visit to his usual professional adviser, if he
have one, is postponed, and a few more weeks go by without
a return of the last symptom. The next attack, which
it is very difficult to avert, and which is sure to accompany
the succeeding debauch, or to follow a cold or fatigue,
does not so speedily subside; the patient finds that he can
not complete the act of making water without several interruptions,
and each attended with a painful desire resembling
that induced by too long a retention of that
fluid. In that state he eagerly seeks medical assistance;
the treatment generally adopted consisting of some sedative,
immersion in a hot bath, or the passage of a bougie.
Relief being thus easily obtained, professional advice is
thus thrown up, and the symptoms are again soon forgotten.
Before proceeding further with the more severe
forms and consequences of stricture, which may now be
fairly said to have commenced in earnest, a brief anatomical
description of the urethra may enable the reader to
understand how the constriction or narrowing of that canal
takes place.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere stated the urethra to be a membranous
canal, running from the orifice of the penis to the bladder,
and situated in the lower groove formed by the <i>corpus
spongiosum</i>.</p>

<p>The difference of opinion entertained by some of our
first anatomists, on the structure of the urethra, is deserving
of notice; for only in proportion to the correctness of
our knowledge of it, can we arrive at a just definition of
its diseases.</p>

<p>One party assert it to be an elastic canal—whether
membranous or muscular they do not say—endowed with
similar properties of elasticity to India rubber, or to a
common spring. That it is elastic, is beyond doubt; but
the mere assertion is no explanation of its mode of action.</p>

<p>Others, from microscopical observations, declare it to
consist of two coats—a fine internal membrane, which,
when the urethra is collapsed, lies in longitudinal folds—and
an external muscular one, composed of very short
<i>fasciculi</i> of longitudinal fibres, interwoven together, and
connected by their origins and insertions with each other,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
and united by an elastic substance of the consistence of
mucus. This is the more satisfactory of the two.</p>

<p>They account for the occurrence of stricture in this
way. They say that “a permanent stricture is that contraction
of the canal which takes place in consequence of
coagulable lymph being exuded between the <i>fasciculi</i> of
muscular fibres and the internal membrane, in different
quantities, according to circumstances.”</p>

<p>A spasmodic stricture they define to be “a contraction
of a small portion of longitudinal muscular fibres, while
the rest are relaxed; and as this may take place, either all
round, or upon any side, it explains what is met with in
practice—the marked impression of a stricture sometimes
a circular depression upon the bougie, at others only on
one side.”</p>

<p>With respect to the change consequent upon permanent
stricture, dissection enables us, in some degree, to arrive
at the truth. Excrescences and tubercles have been found
growing from the wall of the urethra; but in the majority
of instances, the only perceptible change is a thickening
of the canal here and there, of indefinite length; but
whether it be occasioned by the exudation of coagulable
lymph, or whether it be the adhesion of ulcerated surfaces,
which I contend are more or less present in gleet, is not
so easy to determine; at all events, it is undoubtedly the
result of inflammation.</p>

<p>With regard to the action of spasm, all we know of it
is theoretical; but experience every day furnishes instances
of its occurrence.</p>

<p>Spasmodic stricture is generally seated at the neck of
the bladder, and may occur to persons in good health, from
exposure to wet or cold; from some digestive derangement;
from long retention of the urine, particularly while
walking, owing to the absence of public urinals; or to
violent horse exercise; but more frequently does it happen
to those young men who, when suffering from gleet or
gonorrhœa, imperfectly or only partially cured, are tempted
to commit an excess in wine, spirits, or other strong
drinks. Surrounded by jovial society, glassful after glassful
is swallowed, each one to be the last. The patient,
with his bladder full to repletion, scarcely able to retain
his water, yet probably “<i>going</i>” every moment, represses
his desire until the party breaks up, when, on encountering
the cold air, he finds himself unable to void<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
even a drop, or if so, but with extreme difficulty. The
greater the effort, and the more determined the straining,
the greater is the impossibility, and unless relief should
be afforded, the most alarming consequences may ensue.</p>

<p>The rationale is this: the patient, opposing the action
of the muscles of the bladder, by contracting those of the
urethra, they (the latter), from irritation, become spasmodically
contracted.</p>

<p>The urine, by the powerful action of the muscles of the
bladder, is forced against the contracted portion of the
urethra; and by its irritation increases the mischief.
Where neglected, or unless the spasms yield, extravasation
will take place, mortification ensue, and death follow.</p>

<p>The urethra is situated at the under part of the penis,
and is embraced by a substance called the <i>corpus spongiosum</i>;
it (the urethra) consists of several different layers
or coats—the inner, the one continuous with that lining
the bladder, which possesses the power of secreting a mucous
fluid, and the other made up of muscular fibres,
which give to the urethra the power of contracting and
dilating, that regulates the flowing or jetting of the fluid
which has to pass through it. The mucous membrane
of the urethra is of a highly sensitive nature, and more so
in some parts than in others, as, for instance, in the membranous
and bulbous portion of the canal; and hence it
will be found, that those are the parts most liable to disease.
The mucous membrane has several openings called
<i>lacunæ</i>, for the furnishing a particular fluid to moisten and
lubricate the urinary tube: these also are frequently
the seat of disease. These are seen in the drawing on
page <a href="#Page_50">50</a>.</p>

<p>In passing a bougie in contracted and irritable urethra,
it sometimes enters the opening marked B, and if violence
be used in propelling the instrument, false passages are
made.</p>

<p>Independently of the function of the urethra being to
discharge the urine, it has also to convey the semen to the
orifice of the glans; and here in this act is to be observed
the wonderful adaptation of means to an end. During
the excitement attendant upon venereal commerce, the
seminal fluid accumulates, prior to emission, in the bulbous
portion, and when the fitting moment arrives for its
ejection, the membranous portion spasmodically contracts,
thereby preventing the regurgitation of the semen into the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
bladder, while the muscles surrounding the bulbous portion
contract with energetic force, and so complete the
transmission of the generative fluid. Such are the functions
of the urethra in health.</p>

<p>Now, this canal being extensively
supplied with nerves, that have more extensive
communication with others than any particular ones have
in the whole body, and made up, as before stated, of surficial
and muscular membranes, and exposed to the performance
of several duties which are often unduly called
into exercise, can not be supposed to be exempt from the
consequences of such misappropriation; and therefore it
is very liable to inflammation. From the sensitive nature
of the tube, it is very obnoxious to spasm, which may be
partial, general, temporary, or continuous: hence spasmodic
stricture. This condition is of course dependent
upon many causes, excess of diet, fatigue, cold, &amp;c., irritating
the general system; when from the local irritation
previously set up in the urethra by the forenamed causes—a
neglected gleet or clap—the urethra is not long in participating
in it: the phenomena are the symptoms recently
narrated. Highly restorative as the powers of nature
may be to remove disease, she does not appear readily disposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
to interfere with the processes set up in the machine
she inhabits, for self-defence, to protect itself from the
constant irritation produced by the daily flow of acrid
urine, which in several cases often produces ulceration;
coagulable lymph is thrown out in the cellular structure
of the particular diseased part, thereby thickening the
walls thereof, and constituting permanent stricture, it appearing
preferable to impede a function which a narrowing
of the urethric canal does, namely, that of urinating,
than of allowing ulceration to ensue, whereby the urine
would escape into the neighboring parts, and occasion
great devastation, and probably death. Permanent stricture,
as its name implies, outlives the patient; <i>it never
yields, unassisted by art</i>. I have described the ordinary
symptoms of stricture, especially that form induced by
gonorrhœa. Stricture may arise from other causes. Inflammation,
in whatever way set up, if allowed to go on
or remain, will give rise to stricture, and the celerity or
tardiness with which it takes place depends upon circumstance.
An injury from falling astride any hard substance,
blows, wounds, contusions occasioned by riding,
the presence of foreign substances, the injudicious use of
injections, and lastly, which is as frequent a cause as any
one of those heretofore enumerated, <i>masturbation</i>. The
violent manual efforts made by a young sensualist to procure
the sexual orgasm for the third or fourth time continuously,
I have known to be of that degree that irritation
has been communicated to the whole length of the urethra,
extending even to the bladder; and retention of urine,
in the instance I allude to, ensued, and required much attention
before it could be subdued. Excessive intercourse
with females will give rise to the same effects; not so
likely as in the case preceding, inasmuch as the former
can be practised whenever desired, while the latter needs
a participator. The act of masturbation repeated, as it
is, by many youths and others, day after day, and frequently
several times within each twenty-four hours, must
necessarily establish a sensitiveness or irritability in the
parts, and alteration of structure is sure to follow.</p>

<p>The positive changes which take place in stricture in
the urethral passage are these: there ensues a thickening
and condensation of the delicate membrane and the cellular
tissue underneath, which may possibly unite it to the
muscular coat. This thickening or condensation is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
result of what we call effusion of coagulable lymph. It
will be rather difficult to explain the process; but lymph
is that fluid understood to be the nutritious portion of our
sustenance or system, and which is here yielded up by the
vessels which absorb it, and which vessels abound, with
few exceptions, in every tissue of our body. However, it
will suffice to say, that where inflammation takes place,
there is an alteration of structure, and that alteration is
generally an increase. In stricture, this increase or thickening
takes place, as I observed before, in particular parts
of the urethra, but where the inflammation is severe, no
part is exempt, and whole lengths of the passage become
occasionally involved. It is true, certain parts are more
predisposed than others, as, for instance, the membranous,
bulbous, and prostatic portions of the canal; but there
are oftentimes cases to be met with where these parts are
free, and the remainder blocked up. This effusion or
thickening assumes various shapes, and selects various
parts of the urethra. The subjoined diagram will convey
a tolerably perfect idea of the malady in question; indeed
it is a beautiful specimen of simple stricture.</p>

<p>To continue the description of the formidable consequences
of neglected stricture.</p>

<p>In protracted and neglected cases, that part of the urethra<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
between the stricture and bladder becomes dilated,
from the frequent pressure of the urine upon it, induced
by irritability of the bladder, which has an increasing desire
to empty itself. In process of time, complete retention
of urine will ensue, ulceration will take place at the irritable
spot, and effusion of urine into the surrounding parts
will follow; and the consequences will be, as in the instance
of the spasmodic affection, <i>fatal</i>, unless controlled
by the skilful interference of the surgeon.</p>

<p>The symptoms of permanent stricture are often as slow
in their progress, and as insidious in their nature, as they
are appalling in their results, and are seldom distinctly
observed by the patient, until firmly established.</p>

<p>He is suffering from a long-continued gleet, and is first
alarmed by a partial retention of urine—it passes by drops,
or by great straining, or not at all. This usually occurs
after intemperance, and is relieved by the warm bath, fomentations,
and laxative medicines. This is the first stage,
and is attributed to the debauch solely; whereas, at this
time an alteration of structure is going on in the urethra.
Its calibre is becoming diminished, which necessarily causes
the urine to flow in a smaller stream. This is not
observed at first; and it is only after a long period that
the patient becomes aware of the fact.</p>

<p>The disease proceeds. In the morning, from the gluing
together of the sides of the urethra, by the discharge
from its diseased surface, the urine flows in a forked or
double stream; and then, as this agglutinution is dissolved,
it become natural.</p>

<p>There is a greater and more frequent desire to make
water, disturbing sleep many times during the night, but
unattended with pain, unless the neck of the bladder be
affected.</p>

<p>There are also uneasy sensations in the perinœum, a
sense of weight in the pelvis, with flying pains in the
hips; and in the permanent stricture there is a remarkable
symptom frequently prevailing—that is, a pain extending
down the left thigh from the perinœum.</p>

<p>As the disease advances, the urine flows in only a very
small stream, or forked, twisted, double, or broken, or in
drops; and the patient solicits the flow by pressing with
his finger on the perinœum, and elongating the canal,
somewhat after the manner in which a dairy-maid milks
a cow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>The dilatation of the urethra between the stricture and
the bladder already alluded to, now takes place; and some
urine remains in the dilated part, which oozes through
the stricture, making the patient wet and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>There is great difficulty felt, and more time is occupied
in getting rid of the last drop of water, than formerly.
This sensation continues all along; and the cure is never
accomplished until this is finally removed.</p>

<p>If the stricture is still neglected, more severe symptoms
come on, and the neighboring parts become affected
also.</p>

<p>The <i>sphincter ani</i>, or the muscles of the anus, are relaxed,
from the excessive action of the abdominal muscles; and
the fæces pass in small quantities involuntarily. There
is a protrusion of the bowel, which adds to the distress,
and, by its irritation, brings on a looseness or diarrhœa.</p>

<p>The prostate gland, which is seated near the neck of
the bladder, suffers inflammation and enlarges, beginning
at the orifice of the ducts, which open into the urethra.</p>

<p>The emission of semen, which often happens involuntarily,
is attended with agonizing pain, producing cold
shiverings, followed by heat; and fever soon becomes
fairly established.</p>

<p>The liver and its secretions become diseased, discharging
in the intestines large quantities of vitiated bile. The
fever assumes the intermittent character. The discharge
from the urethra is greatly increased in quantity, showing
the formation and bursting of an abscess of the prostrate
gland into it.</p>

<p>The bladder is much thickened and diminished in size,
and acutely or chronically inflamed. The desire to make
water is continual, allowing hardly a moment of rest;
and the patient, in the agony of despair, prays to be relieved
from his sufferings.</p>

<p>Soon succeeding the irritation of the prostate, the testicles
become involved, the disease being propagated by
means of their ducts, which open into the urethra. The
testicles swell a little, become uneasy and painful, and a
dropsical or hardened enlargement ensues.</p>

<p>When the stricture forms a nearly complete obstruction
to the passage of urine, the violent efforts of the bladder
to expel it bring on ulceration or rupture of the urethra,
through which the urine is forced into the cellular membrane,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
with all the power of a spasmodically excited bladder.</p>

<p>The scrotum and neighboring parts become distended,
erysipelas supervenes, black patches of mortification break
out in different places, the febrile symptoms are augmented,
and the patient at last irrecoverably sinks into a state
of coma or muttering delirium, and death closes the scene.
Such is the progress and termination of stricture when
neglected.</p>

<p>The reader, if he be an afflicted one, will eagerly turn
to the page wherein the treatment of this formidable and
distressing malady is considered; and great will be his
satisfaction and delight, on finding it remediable by such
simple means, and entirely within his own control; more
especially if he direct his attention to the disease in its
earlier stages.</p>

<p>He must by no means, however, be too sanguine, from
these remarks, or indulge in the idea that as stricture is
remediable, it is unimportant when the cure be attempted;
the longer the delay, the greater will be the cost to the
patient; and, furthermore, the slightest deviation from the
instructions laid down, will surely aggravate the disease,
and increase the embarrassment of the sufferer.</p>

<p>The following diagrams are further explanatory of the
stricture in its amplified forms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 261px;">

<p>The dark marginal line denote the calibre of the urethra,
and the inner lines the actual diameter of the obstructed
passage. Figure 1 shows the stricture to be on
the lower part of the urethra. Figure 2 the upper part.
Figure 3 exhibits a stricture of some length, and a somewhat
contracted state of the whole canal. Figure 4 denotes
a very common form of stricture, which resembles a
flour-bag tied in the middle; it is the least difficult to cure
of any, because it signifies that the seat of irritation is
limited; but these cases are generally precursory to severer
forms, if not promptly attended to. Figure 5 represents
a stricture of considerable length, and of course very
difficult of removal.</p>

<p>There are many provocatives to stricture, and when
once mischief is progressing, it makes up for its slow initiation
by giant strides. A patient may have a trifling
stricture for years without experiencing much inconvenience.
He takes cold, fatigues himself, commits some
stomachic or other excess, may possibly have fever, all of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
which more or less disturb the general economy, alter the
character of the urine, and in that manner doubly accelerate
the disorganization going on in the urethra. A
small abscess may spring up <i>in</i> the urethra, or <i>below</i> it
among the cellular membranes and integuments. In either
case, it chances now and then to burst an opening
and create a communication externally with the urinary
passage, constituting what is called <i>fistula</i>. A person laboring
under stricture is always liable to these occurrences.
As much mischief is done oftentimes by mismanagement
as by neglect. The clumsy introduction of a
bougie, or, in other instances, the unjustifiable introduction
of one, is likely to, and very frequently does, lacerate
the delicate and irritable membrane, and make a false<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
passage. Figure 6 exhibits an instance at Nos. 1 and 2;
the upper numerical shows a false passage made by a
bougie, and an obliteration of the ordinary passage of the
urethra, the result of inflammation, constituting an impassable
stricture; the lower figure exhibits a false opening
made, in the first instance, by a fruitless effort at
passing an instrument, when inflammation completed the
process. No urine escaped from it of course, because
communication was cut off from the bladder by the impassable
stricture; the outlet for the discharge of that
fluid being through a sinuous opening marked No. 2, the
No. 3 denoting the closed end of the urethra. The case
happened to a man in very ill health, who was prone to
ulceration, and he gradually sunk under exhaustion from
debility and premature old age. Figure 7 exhibits a stricture
where the posterior part was enlarged by the constant
pressure of the urine to escape through the narrowed
part of the urethra; ulceration ensued, and a fistulous
opening was the consequence; the stricture was
seated high up, and the fistulous canal was several inches
long, terminating in the upper and posterior part of the
thigh; the urine used to dribble through it as well as
through the urethra. The patient had been a seafaring
man; he was in exhausted health from hot climates and
intemperate living, and he died at last of consumption. I
have the parts showing the stricture and the fistulous
opening by me, in a state of good preservation. In Figure
8 is presented an illustration of extensive ulceration
producing two fistulous openings; the state of the urethra
was only discovered after death, the patient having concealed
his infirmity for many years; he died suddenly
from apoplexy, being found dead in his bed by the people
of the house where he lodged. Figure 9 portrays irregular
and extensive ulceration. The patient died from
syphilis, having gonorrhœa at the same time. I have the
preparation. Figure 10 shows an impervious urethra,
and a fistulous opening through which the urine flowed.
The urinary passage was blocked up within two inches
from the orifice, and the length of the obstruction was
perhaps a quarter of an inch. It was perforated successfully
by the lanceted stilette, and the passage thereby rendered
continuous; the catheter was worn for several days,
and the false opening soon healed after a slight application
or two of nitric acid. Numerous other illustrations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
might have been given, but the preceding convey a passable
notion of the simplest, and most confirmed, and most
severe forms, of the malady in question.</p>

<p>It is melancholy, notwithstanding the resisting and reparative
power of nature to avoid so saddening a disease
as stricture, that it is so very prevalent, and that it is occasioned
by so many causes. Where it is not destructive
to life, it is very injurious. It involves, where it is severe,
other important organs beside the seat of its abiding;
the repeated calls upon the bladder, through sympathy
of the irritation, created so near to that viscus, the
efforts which at all times it is obliged to make, although
assisted by the muscles of the abdomen and contiguous
parts to void its contents, at last, and very frequently end
in paralysis, and total inability to pass water ensues, except
through the aid of the catheter. Independently of
which, where so much disease exists as in the urethra,
the urine also constantly pressing against ulcerating and
irritable surfaces, extravasation of that secretion takes
place, and the most formidable and alarming consequences
ensue. In the simplest form of stricture, many important
functions are disturbed. A very frequent consequence
is permanent irritability of the bladder, so that the
patient is obliged, ten or twelve times a day, to micturate,
and is unable to pass through the night without suffering
nearly the same inconvenience. Besides which, the natural
sensitiveness of the genital organs becomes speedily
and much impaired. I am satisfied that where disorganization
of the testicles does not exist, and where the patient
is young, or even middle-aged, if he be impotent, he
will in nine cases out of ten be found to have stricture.
There are exceptions, which shall be named when speaking
on the infirmities of the genital system, but in nearly
all cases of impuissance there will be found, if not stricture,
at least some morbid irritability of the urethra. During
the existence of stricture, there is generally a vitiated
secretion from the seat of mischief, constituting a
gleet; therefore a gleet at all times should be regarded,
lest it be an indication of something more than a mere
weeping from enfeebled vessels.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p><i>On the Treatment of Stricture.</i>—Having fully described
the symptoms and progress of stricture, I proceed to the
more pleasing part of treatment. Stricture, if early attended
to, is a disease easy remediable: if neglected, its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
horrors accumulate, and sufferings the most acute close
the scene. Such, however, is the progress of science, that
it is almost possible to cure the most inveterate case, at
all events to relieve it; but that is no reason why the initiatory
notices should be disregarded. Stricture, as must
be perceived, is of two kinds, spasmodic and permanent:
the treatment of the first is chiefly medical, the treatment
of the latter chiefly mechanical. The principal agents I
rely upon in the cure of the former, are the warm bath,
rest, sedatives, and certain dietetic restrictions; for the
removal of the latter, I place unbounded confidence in the
practice of <i>dilatation</i>; and I am of opinion that the other
methods, namely, the application of caustic or the scalpel,
might be dispensed with altogether, if the dilating method
be not delayed too long.</p>

<p>Before commencing the cure of stricture, I need hardly
observe, that we ought to be fully satisfied of its existence.
Symptoms are not always unerring guides; and,
therefore, our reliance should not wholly depend on them.</p>

<div class="centered-poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent">——“to be once in doubt</div>
      <div class="verse">Is once to be resolved.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The only mode of ascertaining the precise condition of
the urethra, is by an examination of it, which should not
be delayed a moment after suspicion is entertained of the
impending evil.</p>

<p>For this purpose, it is recommended that a solid silver
sound should be used as the best instrument; because it
will pass with much less pain or inconvenience. It should
be made conical, that is, smaller at the point than at the
shaft, and of a size to pass very readily into the orifice;
the shaft or body of the sound should not exceed two
thirds of the size of the canal. The sound should be
warmed, and afterward it should be well oiled. The directions
for examining the urethra pertain to the passage
of a bougie or catheter; and as it often falls to the lot of
a patient, that he is beyond medical assistance, it behooves
him to learn how an instrument should be passed, in order
that in emergencies he may officiate himself; besides, it
often happens, in cases of diseased bladder, and in those
cases where retention of urine frequently occurs, that an
invalid can not command the necessary constant attendance
of his professional man; and therefore such knowledge
will well repay any little time or trouble bestowed in
the acquisition. The two annexed drawings will render<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
the commonest observer a proficient. The first shows the manner in
which the bougie is to be introduced. Where the instrument can be
passed thus far, without the assistance of the other hand than that
which holds the bougie, it is better, as it keeps the penis and the
muscles which influence it in a passive state. When the instrument has
passed as far as it will, in the direction the dotted lines denote, it
is to be turned gently round, raising the handle toward the abdomen. A
slight pressure is then to be made <i>downward</i>, and the handle of the
catheter or bougie at the same time to be borne away from the body.
See diagram. The instrument will, if there be no impediment, gradually
slip into the bladder. A trial or two will perfect and surprise the
novice. The same directions apply to the introduction and use of all
other instruments into the urethra. The sensation experienced on having
a bougie passed, partakes more of a strange tickling feeling than
absolute pain, except there exist stricture, and even then the urethra,
on a subsequent trial, is almost insensible to it.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>If soreness or pain is felt, on the sound passing over
the affected part, we may presume there is chronic inflammation
of the urethra, or that the surface is ulcerated, as
in long standing gleet. If the sound meet with an impediment,
but proceeds after a little pressure, it indicates a
thickening of the mucous membrane, the forerunner of
stricture.</p>

<p>I may here observe, that stricture is generally found to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
exist either within an inch of the orifice, or at about six
inches and a half from it, or in the prostate part of the
urethra.</p>

<p>If the sound passes, without hinderance, the last situation,
but with increased pain, the membrane of that part
is diseased, and may extend to the bladder; which will be
indicated by the frequent desire to micturate during the
night, owing to the irritable state of that organ.</p>

<p>If the instrument be arrested at about six inches and a
half, the complaint, in all probability, is seated in the transverse
portion of the prostate, and requires very cautious
treatment.</p>

<p>When the obstruction is at the very entrance of the
bladder, a resistance will be perceived, which, on yielding,
will impart a peculiar sensation as the sound enters
the bladder. When stricture is thus situated, there is a
frequent desire, with almost total inability, to micturate;
and when once formed, it is productive of the most serious
mischief, unless relieved.</p>

<p>In cases of permanent stricture, the passing of the
sound conveys the sensation of going over a ridge. Where
it meets with a temporary stoppage, and then passes on,
it has probably hitched to a fold of the urethra. Sometimes
it will enter the orifice of a dilated follicle; and if
much pressure is used, it will occasion considerable bleeding.</p>

<p>The nature and situation of the disease being ascertained,
the cure may now be proceeded in, recollecting
that no force is to be used, and that too much be not attempted
at one essay. Now without entering into an inquiry
as to the laws on which <i>contraction</i> and <i>elasticity</i> of
certain animal structures depend, it is enough for our purpose
to know, that the urethra possesses both properties;
it may contract so as to oppose the exit or entrance of the
smallest stream, and it may be dilated to admit the introduction
of an instrument an inch in circumference. The
urethra maintains these properties in disease as well as in
health, and upon the strength of this fact, is the practice
of dilatation in the cure of permanent stricture founded,
permanent stricture, it will be recollected, is a positive
narrowing of the urethric canal; and as it is the nature
of all organic diseases to progress, unless prevented by
art, it needs no stronger argument than necessity to show
how imperative it is to set about their removal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>The cure by dilatation is as follows:—the seat and size
of the stricture being ascertained (both of which can be
easily done by the passing of the sound as directed, and
the observance of the stream of urine), a bougie in circumference
somewhat larger than the calibre of the urinary
current, warmed and dipped in an oleaginous mixture
combined with some sedative (Forms <a id="FManchor_22"></a><a href="#Form_22" class="fmanchor">22</a>,
<a id="FManchor_23"></a><a href="#Form_22" class="fmanchor">23</a>,
<a id="FManchor_24"></a><a href="#Form_22" class="fmanchor">24</a>) or stimulant
(Form <a id="FManchor_25"></a><a href="#Form_25" class="fmanchor">25</a>) according
to circumstances, is to be passed to the stricture, and
the gentlest pressure is to be employed for the space of
five, ten, or twelve minutes, according to the irritation it
produces, removing it as soon as any uneasiness is felt.</p>

<p>Even in this very simple operation, a certain dexterity
is requisite; for the direction of all urethræ is not alike,
and the mere pushing a bougie against a contracted part
is not the only likely method of effecting a free passage.
Much also depends upon the nature of the bougie—the
elastic ones, although assisted in their attempted passage
to the bladder, by the smooth and well lubricated sides of
the urethra, have a tendency to straighten; and unless
considerable rotatory motion be observed, are apt to hitch
in a fold of the urethra, especially if the case befall a person
of relaxed fibre, and he be much worn down by suffering.
The bougies that I employ are constructed upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
an improved plan to those in general use, being prepared
of a material that will preserve the shape I adapt them
to, previously to introducing them, but at the same time
sufficiently soft to yield to any accidental tortuosity of the
tube they are intended to explore. The bougie then is
to be pressed softly, but steadily, against the obstruction,
now and then withholding for a minute the bearing, so as
to allow a respite to the stretched membrane; then renewing
by, what is better done than expressed, an “insinuating”
pressure for the space of the time advised above.
The patient should not be dispirited, even if the bougie
do not perforate the stricture at the first trial; it would
doubtless do so, if longer time were employed, but that is
rarely advisable, except in cases where the urine can
scarcely escape, or much expedition be requisite. Should
the operation even be unsuccessful in this first attempt,
the patient will find his ability to micturate much greater
than before the introduction; but, save in long-standing
and obstinate strictures, I rarely find myself foiled, nor
do those who practise the same method, if they have patience
and skill enough, in overcoming the difficulty at the
first interview. A great advantage of the cure by dilatation,
independently of its safety and efficacy, is the insignificant
pain it occasions; the sensation produced being
only like a pressing desire to make water, which immediately
subsides on withdrawing the bougie.</p>

<p>Another method of dilating a stricture, where it happens
to be of chronic existence, is the passing a plastic
catheter into the bladder, and suffering it to remain all
night, or even for several nights, stopping up the handle
end with a cork or wooden peg, which the patient can remove
when he desires to urinate. The urethra, by this
means, becomes quickly dilated, and much beyond the size
of the instrument. It necessarily confines the patient to
his room and couch; but where an expeditious cure is the
object, as much may be effected in this manner in six days,
as by the ordinary method in as many weeks. Time, however,
it must be remembered, is the working <i>material</i> of
nine tenths of strictured invalids, and a week’s lay-up may
cost a twelve-month’s salary—a purchase too dear to be
generally incurred.</p>

<p>Several other plausible methods have been suggested for
the cure of stricture—one by means of an instrument, that
the operator could enlarge when it was passed into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
urethra, through turning a screw; another, which was to
introduce a tube made of some thin skin, and then to distend
it with wind or water; a third, and oftentimes, in reality,
a very useful and available one, is to compress the
penis around the glans, and suffer the urine, as it accumulated,
to distend the anterior part of the urethra before
the bandage was removed and the urine suffered to escape.
But they have their several disadvantages: the processes,
with the exception of the last, are complicated and uncertain
in their result; the instrument is not so manageable,
or so useful, as an ordinary sound; and the gut, instead
of distending the strictured part, enlarges the healthy portions
of the urethra. The bougie, in proper hands, notwithstanding
it is a simple instrument, is the most positive
and effectual method of curing stricture as yet, or likely to
be, discovered. An entrance, then, having by this means
been gained, a bougie of a larger size is to be selected on
the next occasion, and the same process repeated. It is
never advisable to repeat the operation oftener than once
in two days, and when the urethra is irritable, only every
three or four days.</p>

<p>By continuing in this manner, the stricture gradually
yields, and a bougie as large as the orifice will permit to
enter will at last proceed through the whole passage without
meeting any obstacle. The operation, notwithstanding
this apparent success, should not be wholly laid aside,
but continued until the disposition for contraction is entirely
removed; and the patient should never rest without
occasionally examining his urethra, say once a month (at
least once a quarter), lest he encounter a relapse.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the treatment of stricture in its fortunately
most usual—namely, the mildest—form, I proceed
to consider the treatment of severe kinds—previously to
which, a few remarks upon the various kinds of instruments,
their structure, shape, and size, will render any
subsequent allusion more intelligible.</p>

<p>The diagram here introduced represents the calibre of
the various bougies in general use, and the observer will
perceive, that as they are made to accommodate themselves
to the passage they have to pass, how varied must be the
changes which the urethra undergoes. The last outline
indicates the natural and healthy bore of the urethra.
Bougies are manufactured of different materials: waxen
cloth rolled together, elastic and yielding; flexible metal,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
silver, and gold. The bougies which I employ are constructed
upon an improved plan to those in general use:
the elastic, as they are termed, although assisted in their
attempted passage to the bladder by the smooth and well-lubricated
sides of the urethra, have a constant tendency
to straighten, and consequently are liable to hitch in all
the folds they may encounter, which, in relaxed habits, are
very numerous in the membranous portion of the urethra.
To obviate such a possibility, I prefer that the bougie
should be of such a consistence and manufacture as will
admit of its preserving the shape I adapt it to previously
to introducing it; at the same time the material to be sufficiently
soft to enable it to accommodate itself to any accidental
tortuosity of the tube it is exploring.</p>

<p>Catheters are instruments for the purposes of withdrawing
the urine; they are consequently hollow, and are
made of the same materials as bougies; but the most useful
and to be depended upon are composed of silver. Surgeons,
like other men, have their fancies: a catheter,
when made of silver, has very little flexibility; accordingly
it must be shaped beforehand. Some medical men prefer
them quite straight, others with an immense curve. A
surgeon should possess many forms, as the direction of the
urethra differs almost in all men. The subjoined exhibits
not the size, but the shape of the more useful and those
most generally used. Figures 1, 2, and 3, suffice in most
instances, whereas figure 4 is necessary in cases of enlargement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
of the prostate gland, which presses up the
bladder, and renders the urethral passage consequently
longer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 323px;">

<p>The French employ not only variously curved instruments,
but variously shaped. In peculiar cases they are
doubtlessly useful; but they require to be used only by
persons of skill and judgment. In the next three kinds
are views of such; they are called conical bougies—the
first curved, the second straight. They are made of silver,
waxen cloth, or India-rubber. The third exhibits a
sound, employed to ascertain the seat of the stricture.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the improved method I employ
on finding it necessary to use escharotics. I can not better
explain the process than by submitting a sketch of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
instruments, whereby the mode of application will be instantly
perceived. The instruments are made of silver.
The figures represent No. 8 a curved, No. 9 a straightened,
No. 10 ditto, with enlarged head, which puts the
areola of the stricture on the stretch, and secures the central
part for the application of the caustic, or whatever
substance may be employed.</p>

<p>The next kind of instruments are for the purposes of
dividing or piercing hardened obstructions—one or two
applications creating a passage which a hundred <i>cauterizings</i>
would not effect. When any styptic is applied to a
morbid growth, its tendency is to create a slough, or to
destroy the part whereto it is applied. In some instances
a styptic actually promotes increased action: it may temporarily
destroy the part; but the moment the effect is
over, a reaction follows, and the excrescence is increased.
Such is the case in many long-standing, obstinate strictures;
and their removal by perforation or division is rendered
indispensable. The practice requires the most careful
attention and anatomical knowledge; and no one but
a professional man would attempt its employment.</p>

<p>No. 11 sketch exhibits a curved instrument, with the
pointed lancet projecting as when applied. No. 12 exhibits
ditto, but with a differently formed instrument, consisting
of two portions separated, so as to allow a director,
in the form of a thin silver wire with a silver knob, to pass
for the purpose of exploring the passage which the instrument
is to follow and enlarge. It is indispensable in
strictures seated upon the soft and deep parts, lest a false
passage should be made. No. 13 represents a straight instrument;
No. 14 ditto, but with the lancet in reserve—the
last a perforator.</p>

<p>The reader has now been made acquainted with the various
resources the surgeon has at his command. A few
words on their employment will complete the necessary
amount of information to render the one as wise as the
other. By way of recapitulation, the treatment of stricture
is by <i>dilatation</i>, <i>cauterization</i>, and <i>division</i>. They
are to be estimated in the order of their arrangement. By
dilatation is meant the enlarging of the urethral passage
through the frequent introduction of bougies of graduated
sizes. It is an operation unattended with any considerable
pain; its novelty sometimes renders a patient a little
nervous, but a complaint is rarely made after a second or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
third introduction. Indeed, it is oftentimes courted more
frequently than is desirable. The application also of
caustic, or even the perforator, produces scarcely the least
inconvenience. Hemorrhage, of most things to be dreaded,
is less frequent, with cauterizing and cutting instruments
(in skilful hands), than the incautious employment
of blunt-pointed bougies.</p>

<p><i>Diseases of the Testicles.</i>—The testicles, from their office
and connexion with other structures equally as important,
are liable to many excitations. In gonorrhœa they
are subject to sympathetic inflammation, as in <i>hernia humoralis</i>,
which, if neglected or maltreated, gives rise to
abscess or chronic hardness. Inflammation also occurs in
them as in other structures. Accidents, such as blows or
bruises, horse-riding, wearing very tight pantaloons, are
all fertile sources of derangement. Scrofulous constitutions
are predisposed to have their testicles, like the rest
of the glands, diseased. The most frequent disturbance,
however, of the testicles, is a dilatation of the veins, constituting
what is called varicocele; and generally accompanied
by a wasting away of the testicle itself. It is
rare, indeed, to find perfectly healthy testicles in an individual
who has been exposed to amatory pleasures and
sensualities; and as, of course, even amative desire, as
well as amative power, depends upon the absolute sound
condition of the glands in question, the inference is, that
in very numerous persons, the sexual instinct is considerably
diminished, and not unfrequently wholly suppressed,
before half the natural term of their existence has expired,
at which time they ought in reality to be at the climax of
their prime and capability.</p>

<p>It is not so much a painful complaint, as an unpleasant
one. There are occasionally pains in the back and loins,
and other feelings, creating a sensation of lassitude and
weariness; and now and then some local uneasiness is
felt.</p>

<p>Varicocele gives to the examiner a sensation as though
he were grasping a bundle of soft cords. It sometimes
exists to such a degree as to resemble a rupture. In advanced
stages of the disease, or disorganization, the epididymis
becomes detached from the body of the testicle,
and is plainly distinguishable by the finger. The result
of all is, that a considerable diminution of sexual power
takes place; and if means are not adopted to arrest a further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
break-up of the structure, the
venereal appetite will subside altogether.
The annexed drawing
exhibits a tolerably faithful portrait
of the disease; it represents
the varicocele to be on the left
side—the side most usually affected.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 275px;">

</div>

<p>The folds formed by the veins
lapping over each other are clearly
distinguishable, and the dependent
state of the scrotum on
the affected side exhibits very well
the occasion of it. The treatment
consists in giving support by
means of a suspensory bandage, which may be worn during
the day, and the use of local refrigerants night and
morning. The state of health is sometimes mixed up with
it; and tonics and generous diet are useful. The cold
shower bath helps to brace the system. It is a complaint
in which, if it be not of very great severity, nor very long
continuance, much good may be done. In some instances
the veins may be allowed to empty themselves, which they
will do when the body is in a recumbent position, and a
coated ivory ring, or a silken band, may be so placed
around them as shall prevent their refilling. It is, however,
a case fitter for the surgeon’s management.</p>

<p><i>Abscess in the Testicle.</i>—The testicle is subject to inflammation
and suppuration like any other structure. A
case about three years ago fell under my notice, where a
quantity of dark fœtid fluid was released on puncturing a
testicle in which the sense of fluctuation was very evident;
and the patient stated that it had been five or six
years in arriving at that condition. He was wasted considerably
from nocturnal perspirations and acute pain, and
his sexual desire was much diminished. The case did
well, and the latter function was restored without much
loss.</p>

<p><i>Hydrocele.</i>—Hydrocele is an accumulation of yellow serous
fluid in the <i>tunica vaginalis testis</i> (refer to the engravings
in next page), or peritoneal covering of the testicle.
It is a disease incident to every period of life, but more
commonly met with in grown persons. The ordinary formation
of hydrocele is unattended with pain; and the patient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
accidentally discovers the existence of the swelling,
but oftentimes not until it has attained a considerable
magnitude. The tumor, when large, produces an unsightly
appearance, and forms a hindrance to sexual intercourse,
from the integuments of the penis being involved
therein, and thereby preventing a perfect erection of that
organ. The disease may appear to originate spontaneously;
but it is usually traceable to some bruise, blow, or
other external injury to the part.</p>

<p>The two following drawings exhibit the outward and
inward appearance of the scrotum in <span class="nobreak">hydrocele:—</span></p>

<p>The notion that the cure of hydrocele depends on promoting
adhesion to the sides of the tunica vaginalis with
the testicle is somewhat upset by several preparations in
the London hospitals, exhibiting the <i>tunic</i> taken from persons
in whom a radical cure was effected by injection, and
in whom no fluid was reproduced; nor were the sides of
the said investment at all adherent with the testicle, but
apart, as in the healthiest individual. Hitherto surgeons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
acting on the aforesaid notion, with a view to obliterate
the cavity, adopted various plans of treatment—such as,
for instance, laying open the entire cavity, cutting away
a portion of the tunica vaginalis, the application of caustic,
and, lastly, the seton, as advised by Dr. Pott, which
was suffered to liberate itself by ulceration. When, in
any of these instances, suppuration was induced, the cavity
became in time filled up by the granulating process.
The plan of the present day is by perforating the sac with
a trocar, suffering the effused fluid to escape, and injecting
some stimulating liquid which is allowed to remain until a
degree of inflammation is produced, that shall cause an
obliteration of the cavity by adhesion, or, as it has also
been proved, prevent a reproduction of the fluid, by closing
the mouths or altering the diseased action of the exhalent
arteries. Whichever be the effect produced thereby, the
cure is almost certain, and the principles of the treatment
consequently judicious. But, notwithstanding, the operation
is not always immediately, nor <i>ultimately</i> successful;
the degree of inflammation set up may be insufficient, and
the effusion again take place, and the operation may require
a second and third repetition; or an excessive degree
of inflammation may ensue, that shall occasion serious
constitutional disturbance, either by suffering the
injected fluid to remain too long, or its being of too stimulative
a character, or from its escaping into the cellular
membrane of the scrotum, an accident not unfrequent, unless
great care be used in the operation.</p>

<p><i>Radical Cure of Hydrocele.</i>—The term radical is applied
to the process narrated in the last case; but, as has been
observed, the operation is occasionally required to be repeated
several times. In the case I am adverting to, after
tapping, several injections were thrown in between the
tunics, and withdrawn; and on one occasion the morbid
fluid was secreted to the greatest possible distension of the
scrotum by the following morning. Its subsequent withdrawal,
and the injection of a more active stimulant, effected,
however, a permanent cure. In the country, surgeons
frequently plunge a lancet in the scrotum, suffer the
effused liquid to escape, and desire the patient merely to
wrap the parts up in a handkerchief, to take no further
heed, and to ride home: and these cases generally do
well.</p>

<p><i>Hydrocele Cured by Acupuncturation.</i>—A new method of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
treating hydrocele has of late years been introduced,
namely, by the insertion of a needle into the sac or bladder
of the testicle, which, upon its withdrawal, permits the
fluid to escape into the cellular membrane, whence it is
rapidly absorbed. A pint of fluid may be got rid of in
that way in two or three hours; and, although the disease
may not be radically cured, it will occupy several months
before a reaccumulation of the fluid takes place. In recent
cases, this treatment oftentimes proves permanently
successful. Many nervous persons will not submit to
anything approaching an operation, not even to the simple
one of acupuncturation. In such cases, there is no
alternative but counter-irritants, to be applied over the
part, such as the tincture of iodine, or the following ointment
(Form <a id="FManchor_26"></a><a href="#Form_26" class="fmanchor">26</a>).</p>

<p>It is at all times best to attend early to any disease of
the testicles; the progress is so rapid, the mischief so
great, and the consequences so deplorable, of uncontrolled
disease.</p>

<p><i>Eruptions incident to the Organs of Generation and the
Rectum.</i>—The structures included in the above heading
are subject to a variety of eruptions, varying in character,
intensity, and duration. Thus we have the <i>papular</i>, a
chronic inflammation characterized by papules, or very
minute pimples, of nearly the same color as the skin, accompanied
by intense itching, and terminating, when broken
by scratching, in small circular crusts: this is called,
by dermoid pathologists, Prurigo. Another order of eruption
is designated the <i>vesicular</i> and <i>pustular</i>, and consists
of groups of small pimples of a very bright red color, and
containing a serous fluid. They are accompanied by itching,
which increases as the contained humor becomes turbid,
and assumes the puriform aspect; they then incrustate,
and at the end of about a fortnight drop off, leaving
the skin healthy underneath. The name given to this variety
is Herpes.</p>

<p>The last and most inveterate species is characterized by
an itching of the skin, which, on inspection, appears of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
diffused redness, and gives off, after a while, a number of
thin scales: these reaccumulate, and the entire organs of
generation becomes sometimes covered with similar patches:
this is denominated Psoriasis. These affections, which
are but various degrees of inflammation, modified by idiosyncrasy
and habit, arise from local and constitutional
causes. Among these are frequent excitation of the organs
of generation, the contact of the fluids secreted during
sexual intercourse, an unhealthy and relaxed condition
of the genitals, and, lastly, a disordered state of the
digestive organs. It is astonishing to what an extent
these disorders prevail, and more so to find how long the
individuals, probably from a sense of diffidence in seeking
professional assistance, endure them. I have encountered
many patients who have informed me that they have had
the complaint upon them from five to ten years, purposing
during the whole of that period to consult some medical
friend, but postponing it until their interview with myself;
and it is the more to be regretted, as the cure may
always be effected in a week or two, with moderate attention
and perseverance; but if the attempt be neglected,
there is no limiting the extent to which the disease may
proceed. Local diseases, especially of such a nature as
those under consideration can not exist any great length
of time without involving the digestive organs, which become
sympathetically deranged; and in like manner do
local diseases participate with dyspeptic disturbances—each,
therefore, goes on aggravating the other.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<p><i>Diseases of the Bladder.</i>—The anatomical description of
the bladder will be found in the earlier pages of this work.
It may simply be restated:</p>

<p>The bladder is a viscus somewhat similar in structure
to the stomach. It is composed of several coats—muscular,
nervous, and mucous. Each are liable to diseases peculiar
to their several structures. The size of the bladder
differs in most persons, and in the sexes.</p>

<p>The female bladder is generally the largest; but the
largeness is observable more especially in females who
have borne children. The proverbial ability of females
to retain their urine longer than men is thus accounted
for.</p>

<p>Much mischief is often done by both sexes disobeying
the particular “call of nature” to urinate; and the younger
branches should have that fact impressed upon them. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
have known children acquire a severe and obstinate form
of irritability of the bladder by retaining their urine too
long. Diseases of the bladder are generally the consequences
of other complaints, and those complaints have
already been enumerated. They may be thus summed
up:</p>

<p>Gonorrhœa extending to the bladder, and producing
absolutely a clap of the bladder. If the inflammation is
not subdued, or does not subside, probably some permanent
mischief ensues; at all events, the inflammation extends,
and involves other coats than the interior. Accordingly,
we have inflammation of the muscular coat, the
nervous coat, and, lastly, the peritoneal coat. These terminations,
severally, have certain symptoms, and certain
names.</p>

<p>There are others, and among them may be named colds,
local injuries, hæmorrhoids, excess in drinking particular
fluids, sensual indulgences, diseased condition of the kidneys,
or long retention or vitiated states of the urine, nervousness,
and, lastly, the formation of stone in the bladder.
The most common form of bladder ailment is irritability,
which is a milder term for inflammation. Then we
have absolutely inflammation, and, lastly, loss of power,
or paralysis.</p>

<p><i>Irritability of the Bladder.</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>—The chief indication of disease
affecting the bladder is a frequent desire which the
patient experiences to pass his water; but that symptom
alone does not determine the nature of the complaint. It
may be irritable from sympathy with surrounding irritation,
and disappear on the subsidence of that irritation.
It may constantly be fretting the patient by its contractions,
through the urine (owing to some general derangement
in the system, being altered in its chemical qualities)
exciting the bladder the moment it is secreted therein; or
it may be the result of nervous agitation, with or without
any actual diseased state of the bladder. These causes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
should be understood to regulate the treatment, which of
course must be qualified by the provocation, and which
the patient, when in doubt, had better leave to the discrimination
of his physician.</p>

<p><i>Paralysis of the Bladder.</i>—The bladder may become,
through loss of nervous stimulus, insensible to irritation,
and consequently be disobedient to its natural functions.
The urine, in these cases, accumulates in large quantities,
distends the bladder to its utmost, which it does without
pain; and the excess of secretion then dribbles away involuntarily.
This state of the bladder is called paralysis,
and is an aggravated form of disease, arising from the
same causes that establish inflammation, or from some
contiguous nervous injury. The treatment of paralysis
of the bladder must be intrusted to experienced hands; it
consists chiefly of purgatives, stimulative enemata up the
rectum, the introduction of the catheter, the cold bath,
rest, and general medicinal nervous excitants.</p>

<p><i>Inflammation of the Bladder.</i>—Cases of acute inflammation
of the bladder are of rare occurrence; but they do
occur, occasionally prove fatal, and always are productive
of much general disturbance, which yields not without
vigorous and active treatment. Gonorrhœa is most usually
the exciting cause. On the sudden suppression of
the urethral discharge, an inflammation sympathetically
seizes the testicle, the glands in the groin, or the bladder;
and when the latter is the seat of the transference, it may
be held as the ratio of the severity of the disease. In inflammation
of the bladder, there is a constant desire to
pass water, which, when made, is usually in very small
quantities, and leaves a sediment. The patient often experiences
an insupportable inclination to urinate, with a
sensation as though the bladder were ready to burst—whereas
there may be little or no urine in it. There is
much pain at the root of the penis, and it extends along
the perinœum to the rectum, which latter is assailed with
almost constant spasms resembling straining. There is
considerable thirst, fever, and anxiety; the pulse is full
and quick, the tongue furred, and all those symptoms are
present that prevail during severe constitutional excitement.
The treatment consists of bleeding, leeching, or
cupping; relieving the bowels by castor oil and injections;
giving mucilaginous drinks, administering opiates,
preserving rest, and total abstinence from stimulating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
diet. If these means fail in subduing the inflammation
it runs on to ulceration, permitting extravasation of urine
occasioning mortification and death; but where they are
effectual, the patient is soon left free from complaint. It
often happens that the inflammation is not so vigorously
treated, or it may be wholly neglected, and yet it may
happily resolve itself without proceeding to the extremity
narrated; but, unfortunately, it may degenerate into a
minor but not less troublesome form, denominated chronic,
and which, in fact, is the disease christened “irritability,”
and the one, for obvious reasons, as above stated, for
which relief is most usually sought, the patient having in
vain daily looked for the subsidence of his malady. Having
stated that irritability of the bladder must be treated
with reference to its cause, it is obvious that more than
non-medical discrimination is required. Where it depends
upon stricture, the stricture must be first cured; where
upon stone in the bladder, the stone must be removed;
where upon sympathetic inflammation, the source must be
attacked, and so on.</p>

<p>However, it has been stated that other causes may exist—that
it may even be a primary disease in itself; and
as this treatise professes to be a private mentor to the invalid,
I will detail such measures as may be safely adopted
for the cure of a complaint as often borne from being
trusted to unskilful hands, as from a morbid delicacy in
seeking proper and legitimate relief. The ordinary symptoms
are, first, an inordinate desire to make water; it
flows in small quantities, with pain before, during, and
after. The urine has an offensive ammoniacal odor; it
deposites a thick, adhesive mucus, of a gray or brown
color, sometimes streaked with blood, and of an alkaline
character.</p>

<p>In this stage of affairs, rest is indispensable; sedatives
and opiates may be given; but alkalies (rarely omitted in
prescriptions for incontinence of urine) should not be indiscriminately
given, for they only render the urine more
alkaline, which occasions it to deposite calcareous flakes,
that, if not passed off, accumulate, unite, and lay the
foundation of that frightful disease, stone in the bladder.
The extract of <i>conium</i>, or <i>henbane</i>, combined with mucilage,
may be given in doses of three to five grains every
six hours. The <i>tincture of henbane</i>, in doses of a <i>fluid-drachm</i>,
or the <i>tincture of opium</i>, not exceeding <i>ten or fifteen</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
<i>drops</i> at a time, may be given in like manner, and
continued for several days, keeping the bowels open with
castor oil. The daily or alternate daily use of the hot,
general, or hip bath, will afford immense relief. The
various preparations of <i>morphine</i>, <i>aconitine</i>, and of <i>hops</i>,
possess great power in small and frequent doses. The
<i>uva ursi</i> is a remedy of ancient note, and is often prescribed
with advantage; the dose is one scruple to a
drachm in milk, or any bland fluid, three times a day, or
it may be taken in infusion or decoction, one ounce to a
pint of water—that quantity to be drank during the day.
The <i>pareira brava</i>, exhibited in a decoction (by simmering
three pints of water, containing half an ounce of the
root, down to a pint), may be taken in divided doses of
eight or twelve ounces during the day, or in the form of
extract, in quantity of a scruple, which equals the above
amount of decoction.</p>

<p>The <i>achillæ millefoliæ</i> is an excellent plant, and possesses
astonishing astringent powers, often restoring the
tone of the bladder to a healthy condition, when all other
remedies have failed. A handful of the leaves are to be
infused in a pint of boiling water, which, when cool, may
be poured off, and given in doses of a cupful three times
a day. Any of the preceding sedatives may be given in
conjunction with these preparations.</p>

<p>Lime-water taken with milk, as an ordinary drink, is a
useful corrective.</p>

<p>The <i>buchu</i> (the <i>diosma crenata</i>)—an ounce infused for
several hours in a pint of boiling water, and a wineglassful
of the cooled liquid administered three or four times a
day—has justly obtained some notoriety.</p>

<p>Where all these means prove ineffectual, the injection
of sedative and astringent applications often answers the
most sanguine expectations; but they should be employed
only by professional persons, and even then with great
care; as when the disease has been at its height, and
they have been used, much inconvenience, and even mischief,
has been occasioned. A mild infusion of poppies,
or weak gruel, may be thrown in, once or twice a day, in
quantities not exceeding two or three ounces at a time,
and withdrawn after being suffered to remain thirty or
forty seconds. A catheter, with elastic bag, should be the
instrument used.</p>

<p>In the more chronic forms, where the urine does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
deposite much mucus, or is tinged with blood, the addition
of ten drops (<i>very gradually</i> increasing the quantity)
of the diluted nitric acid may be made to the fluid injected,
repeating or declining the operation, as the effects
are discovered to be advantageous or prejudicial.</p>

<p>In an irritable state of the bladder depending on some
disease of the kidney, there is a frequent desire to void
the urine without there being any, or but very little, urine
in the bladder. There is also a severe cutting pain felt
about the neck of the bladder, especially after each effort
to make water, followed or attended by a “languid” pain
in the loins. The urine is often the color of whey, at
other times tinged with blood, and deposites, when suffered
to remain a while, a purulent sediment. The severe
symptoms should be allayed by the same remedies as prescribed
in irritable bladder arising from other causes; but
the original seat of the disease in this instance demands
energetic attention. The various counter-irritants are in
great requisition; leeches, blisters, setons, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In addition to the tonics and astringents already advised,
an infusion of the <i>wild-carrot seed</i>, made by macerating
for a couple of hours one ounce of the seeds bruised
in a pint of boiling water (drinking, when cool and strained,
the whole of the liquid in divided doses during the day),
may be taken with every chance of relief. As in the other
infusions, the patient must persevere in the use of this for
some time.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">ORIGIN OF THE VENEREAL DISEASE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reader will allow that it can not be for want of
materials to produce a book, that this subject is introduced,
as the multifarious nature of this work’s contents
will readily testify; but it is briefly to explain certain
probabilities and conjectures which the afflicted curious
are generally desirous of being satisfied upon. Who
ever suffered under syphilis but was solicitous to know
how such a plague came into the world? Many moralists
believe and insist that it is a specific punishment,
sent for our physical transgressions. Philosophically
speaking, such it is; because the infringement of any
natural law always incurs a penalty. However, if it
be a manifestation of divine displeasure, it certainly is
most unequally apportioned; for it generally happens to
the least licentious, instead of the most depraved—the
timid, scrupulous, and nervous man, contracting it on the
first loose intercourse, whereas the man of the town revels
almost with impunity; and, lastly, he who exercises the
greatest caution and cleanliness escapes it altogether, although
he may be the most deserving of the infliction. In
a state of timorous excitement, we are more apt to catch
the latent mischief. The careless, thoughtless libertine,
hardened against infection by indifference, free living, and
probably strong health, often escapes scot-free; and the
cool and calculating pleasure-hunter, who exercises those
useful antagonists to disease, namely, ablution and selection,
comes off triumphant with still greater certainty.</p>

<p>The point at issue is, when the disease first arose, and
where. Medical historians give credit to America, Spain,
and France, for its propagation; and controversies have
been carried on by various parties, each disclaiming the
honor. Now, as I do not propose to analyze the authorities,
but simply to venture my own opinion, with the reasons
for the same, I have no alternative but to refer the
reader, if he be dissatisfied with my attempted exposition,
to more comprehensive and elaborate conjectures than my
own. Starting upon the proposition that nature’s laws<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
are unalterable, and believing that fever is, and has been
fever since the creation of the world; that a cut finger has
healed by the first intention, or has <i>festered</i>, and ever may
do so—each condition being modified by the state of health
of the party, and the nature of the wound; that a broken
limb was attended with the same consequences in the year
1 as it will be in the year 1900; and that dirtiness generated
itch, and does so still: I can not reconcile myself
to any other belief, but that any violation of the laws
whereupon sexual intercourse has been permitted, has
been, is, and will be, attended with corresponding results;
and as such violations most likely exist where numbers cohered
together, I consider both gonorrhœa and syphilis to
have been coeval with the origin of mankind. They both
doubtlessly are much modified by climate, habits, and constitution;
and therefrom ensue the many modifications we
see in Europe, and the other large portions of the globe.
The proofs that can be adduced in favor of this hypothesis
are interminable.</p>

<p>It is said that, until the arrival of some British sailors
at Otaheite, the disease was unknown in that territory.
Possibly, in its present modification; but previously to this
new intercourse, it is most probable that the sexual cohabitation
was not so promiscuous or frequent, and that
that very infringement entailed a new form of irritation.
In married persons, of even temperate passions, and of
most careful habits, local sexual disorders are of frequent
occurrence, the slightest derangement of female health
giving rise to vaginal disturbance, that unsuspectingly is
increased by the marital embrace, and communicated to
the husband; and only from its presence does it occur,
that the coitus may have been the cause of it. By attending
to the simple suggestion of nature, namely, abstinence,
cleanliness, and rest, a cure is effected; but where
neglected, or should either party be unfaithful to the marriage
vow, the disease becomes magnified, and extended to,
mayhap, innocent parties.</p>

<p>The next question is, are gonorrhœa and syphilis identical?
Certainly not, any more than the very many modifications
of generative sores. It is absolutely, now-a-days,
a difficult question to solve, whether this or that be
syphilis; so numerous and yet so closely in resemblance
are the ulcers that ensue after sexual cohabitation. The
eye is not to be trusted, because so different is real from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
spurious syphilis that the French surgeons decide the point
by inoculating a healthy portion of the body with the matter
or discharge from what they suppose to be a syphilitic
ulcer. If a corresponding ulcer be produced, the disease
is decided to be syphilis. If, on the other hand, no result
follow, the patient is proclaimed free from that malady,
and stated to be laboring under merely common local irritation.
What is still more curious is this: a patient will
have ulcers, which every medical man will pronounce, on
beholding, to be chancres; yet, upon this trial, the inoculation
will not evince them to be so. A while after, supposing
the chancres to be healed, secondary or other symptoms
will show themselves—sore throat, spotted skin,
glandular enlargements, or painful joints, follow. The
same consequences oftentimes ensue after gonorrhœa.
The primary diseases can not be identical, because the
symptoms are vastly different, and the parts attacked are
also unlike; and yet there is this anomaly, that the after-consequences
frequently closely resemble each other.</p>

<p>Another surprising result from loose intercourse is, that
one female will convey to this individual gonorrhœa, to
another syphilis; a third will escape scatheless, and a
fourth will have a modifiable affection of both diseases.
A satisfactory exposition of the why and wherefore such
things should be, or are, is I fancy beyond the skill of pathologists.
It is enough to know that they happen; and
it is better to use those means which past and daily experience
furnishes to get rid of them, than to ponder and wonder
in the vain endeavor to explore their origin.</p>

<p>In giving an opinion that we have always been liable to
fever, to cut fingers, and to syphilis, I am ready to admit
that these several conditions depend upon the varied states
of health of the parties. The fevers (ensuing upon the
ill-ventilated places) of olden times, compared with those
of the present day, differ in intensity and frequency, because
the causes are neither so numerous nor severe.
The cut finger of a drunkard, and one of otherwise feeble
health, is more likely to fester, and even mortify, than
should the accident befall a temperate and healthy individual;
and the syphilis (or diseases simulating it) at the
present time is less severe than formerly, owing to greater
attention being paid to personal cleanliness, and the simplicity
and earliness of the treatment.</p>

<p>A question worthy of inquiry is, why gonorrhœa and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
syphilis should be infectious? <i>Contagion</i> is a word that
many medical men would expel from worldly usage, not
believing in its existence; that is to say, the extension of
a fever or epidemic, for instance, is not traceable to the
disease seizing the individual, but to the peculiar aptitude
of the party to become the recipient of it. Consumption
is of the most extensive prevalence; but it only occurs in
the delicate—those peculiarly formed, or rendered apt for
it, from the circumstance of their lungs being hereditarily
feebly constructed, or disordered through inflammation following
a cold, and which effects are traceable to an infraction
of some of nature’s laws. Sickly children owe
their condition to their sickly parents, or to their physical
mal-education, or some other positive violation of nature’s
regulations; and in like manner, where the fire rages or
the wind blows, the feeblest and least protected become
the earliest victims. Both gonorrhœa and syphilis furnish
a remarkably irritating purulent fluid, which, applied to
delicate surfaces, produces certain effects. Experiments
have not been made to multiply these effects, beyond those
incurred by sexual freedom; and the one of inoculation
by the French surgeons, as quoted; but accident has
proved that the eye, for instance, puts on, after contact
with the discharge of gonorrhœa, the same kind of inflammation
as follows its contact in coition with the antagonist
generative organs.</p>

<p>The rectum has also been the seat of venereal affection;
and instances have been known of the mouth being also
the recipient of disease communicated by a deposition of
the poison. If there be such a thing as contagion, it certainly
exists in the venereal disease; for, although I admit
it (the disease) may occur spontaneously, or be generated
by half a dozen of each of the sexes herding and
cohabiting together, and neglecting the duties of cleanliness,
or committing excesses, those very circumstances
imply that the disease can be extended, notwithstanding a
majority of the careful and hardy may escape, after a risk
of the same. The fact of its contagious properties is not
upset, because escape is owing to the non-susceptibility of
the parties, and the caution they exercise to prevent a
lodgment of, or contact with, the poisonous matter.</p>

<p>John Hunter observes, that it is only the developed disease
that is communicable, and for the propagation of
venereal affections the <i>poisonous secretion</i> must be deposited.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
So confident was he of this, that he even permitted
married men having gonorrhœa to cohabit with their
wives, to save appearances; care being taken first to clear
all the parts of any matter, by syringing the urethra, then
making water, and, <i>lastly</i>, washing the glans. Such, however,
is my belief of the rapidity of the formation of the
secretion, that, aided by the excitement of the generative
act, the deposite of the same would necessarily take place
with the seminal emission, especially in persons of full
temperament, and in the plenitude of the sexual appetite,
and thereby be liable to communicate the disease.</p>

<p>It is becoming a prevalent fashion to give new names
to the several forms of venereal disease, such as substituting
“urethritis,” “blenorrhagia,” &amp;c., for gonorrhœa;
and even to syphilis are added “tertiary symptoms;” the
names quoted being selected to express more symptoms
than the old ones conveyed. I consider that this circumstance
tends to support my opinion—that gonorrhœa and
syphilis are not identical, and that each disease (the former
being distinguished by urethral discharges, and the
latter by ulcers and other cutaneous disfigurements) has
innumerable varieties. I hold them both to be but modifications
of inflammation from a poisonous source, and its
consequences common to the structures in which they respectively
become seated, and differing in degree according
to the severity of the attack. Another proof in support
of the last assertion is, I think, the time of the appearance
of the particular disease. There is certainly a more usual
time for a clap to manifest itself, such as from the seventh
to the ninth day; but it very often occurs within twenty-four
hours after connexion, and syphilis sometimes as early;
and instances occur where weeks elapse before either
of the forms shows itself.</p>

<p>Briefly to recapitulate, I consider, then—1. That the
generative organs have ever been liable to disease from
misuse; that the disease is variable and modifiable by
many circumstances, such as have been before stated—namely,
climate, age, constitution, and cause. 2. That it
is contagious; mild cases usually producing mild consequences,
but those depending much upon the treatment
and health. 3. Newly-indisposed and severer cases, establishing
a worse form of disease, alike modifiable by circumstances.
I am not prepared to insist that the syphilis
of the present time assumes the aspect as it did with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
ancients, any more than I would affirm that it will be the
same centuries hence: but I contend that all abuses of
sexual pleasures will be surely followed by sexual disturbances,
and that the most likely form of ailment is marked
either by discharges or ulceration; that these diseases
are simple or complicated, and all are separate in themselves.
There is no fixed order in which what are called
secondary symptoms occur. It may more usually happen
that a sore throat will follow the healing of a bubo, as
swelled testicle is more commonly subsequent to the occurrence
of a gonorrhœal discharge; but in very many
cases neither occur, or not in the succession stated. The
anomalies in the disease I shall consider in describing the
symptoms and treatment, when the reader will judge how
far the view herein entertained, as to the origin and character
of the disease, facilitates and simplifies its management
and control.</p>

<p>In conclusion of this part of our subject, I may state,
that I believe the form and severity of any syphilitic disease
depend more upon the state of health and other
aptitudes of the party receiving, than of the one communicating
the disease.</p>

<p><i>Of the Character of the Syphilitic Poison.</i>—“The venereal
poison is only known by the <i>action</i> which follows its
application.” It has been observed, that it is only communicable
by deposition; and that certain parts are essentially
prone to its reception: these are the generative apparatus
of both sexes. The poison is conveyed in the form
of a purulent fluid; that of gonorrhœa from inflamed vessels
with corresponding morbid action; that of syphilis,
also from a purulent fluid emanating from the surface of
an ulcer. The disease prevails only in the human race;
it is impossible to transfer it to animals of a lower kind.
John Hunter soaked lint in matter from a gonorrhœa and
chancre, and introduced it into the vaginæ of bitches and
asses without producing any effect. The same experiment
was tried by interposing the purulent matter within the
prepuce of dogs and male asses, and also by inoculation,
but with no other effect than that of producing a common
sore. The venereal poison attacks the human body in two
ways, locally and constitutionally; the latter by absorption
of the poison secreted by the patient himself. We
can only suppose the local form of the disease to arise
from absorption, and so altering the local action of parts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
as to produce specific results. The constitutional form
is generally an after-occurrence, although instances are
known where it has not been preceded by any apparent
previous form; albeit, no doubt such <i>has</i> existed without
exciting observation. Gonorrhœa shows itself without
abrasion of surface; but syphilis is marked by another
action—an ulceration of the solids whereon it is found.</p>

<p>In Hunter’s Work on the Venereal Disease, there is an
interesting chapter respecting the source of the gonorrhœal
secretion, in which it appears that it is produced
from the vessels investing the mucous membrane of the
urethra, by their becoming altered in their action; and
that ulceration is seldom found within the urethra, and
when so discovered, it is not from the gonorrhœal poison;
and that where ulceration occurs, it must be ascribable to
an accession of inflammation of a distinct character. Both
gonorrhœa and syphilis are conditions assumed by the human
frame in self-defence, and are processes set up to cure
the previous one; and unless the constitution be much
impaired, the disease gets well. Such impediments, however,
exist in the form of moral and social arrangements,
occupation and variable health, that the end, without assistance,
is seldom accomplished. Gonorrhœa may cease
of its own accord; but, according to the belief of Hunter,
syphilis never; and certainly every day’s experience proves
the fact. We see gonorrhœa cured by the most ignorant
persons and by the most empirical measures; but syphilis
often defies the most skilful treatment. The first attack
of venereal affections, especially gonorrhœa, is the most
severe; from which it is presumed that a habit of reconciliation
takes place between the disease and the generative
organs; so that after a recurrence or two of the complaint,
the same party may almost bid defiance to a new
infection. Yet, if a man lose the habit obtained by frequent
intercourse, through abstinence from venereal pleasures,
he will be very likely to contract the disease even
on the first re-essay, with the very same parties, who may
preserve precisely the same condition of health that formerly
was innocuous to him. Cases innumerable can be
adduced in support of this statement. In the first part of
this book, statements have been made, proving that the
difference in the symptoms of gonorrhœa are almost
endless. The same may be anticipated with regard to
syphilis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>
<h2 class="no-page-break">OF SYPHILIS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Syphilis</span> is another and a more violent form of the venereal
disease than gonorrhœa. All its effects and symptoms
are divided into two conditions, <i>primary</i> and <i>secondary</i>;
the former being those which arise either from the
direct application of the virus or poison to the part where
the ulceration first shows itself, or from the irritative and
specific effects of the poison on the absorbent vessels and
glands, as it is passing through them on its way to the
circulation.</p>

<p>Hence, among the first—the primary—may be classed
the <i>ulcer</i>, or <i>chancre</i>, which in almost every instance is situated
on the parts of generation, and may or may not be
followed by a swelling in the glands of the groin, constituting
that form of the complaint called <i>bubo</i>.</p>

<p>The secondary symptoms may be defined to be all those
effects of the disease which take place subsequently to,
and in consequence of, the absorption of the poison into
the system: comprising sore throat, cutaneous affections—both
eruptions and ulcers, pains in the bones and joints,
and swellings thereon, called <i>nodes</i>.</p>

<p>I will first consider the symptoms of primary syphilis—<i>chancre</i>
and <i>bubo</i>.</p>

<p>The coverings and linings of the body differ according
to their situation. The former, the integuments become
hardened by exposure and exercise, and preserve their
velvety softness where protected by clothing, and where
they are subject to less use—instance the hands, feet, face,
and abdomen. Certain functions are assigned to each.
The covering of the feet takes on a horny hardness, and
in like manner the hands of a laborer assume a glove-like
protection. The abdomen, by being constantly clothed,
preserves its soft texture. The lining membranes of the
body have also separate offices to perform—the <i>serous</i> and
<i>mucous</i>, as they are called. The <i>serous</i> is a name given
to those lining the cavities; the <i>mucous</i>, to those having
outlets. From the glans penis being generally covered by
the prepuce, the parts in contact are called mucous. It
differs, however, in sensitiveness, from the urethra. The
entire covering also of the penis is of a very delicate and
tender structure; and hence also, from sexual intercourse,
these parts become the chief seat of syphilis. Gonorrhœa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
confines its attacks to mucous membranes, or, in other
words, secreting surfaces. In fact, the matter deposited
on the common and exposed skin is harmless; so also, but
to a less degree, is that of syphilis. Gonorrhœa is frequently
seated <i>on</i> and <i>around</i> the glans, and the inner surface
of the prepuce; but more frequently, by a hundred
fold, <i>within</i> the urethra. The delicate surface, then, of
the glans and prepuce, losing some of its sensitiveness by
frequent exposure, and losing also the defence of the secretion
which mucous membranes pour out, becomes accessible
to an occurrence of syphilis—a disease that is
readily communicable, by inoculation, to almost any part
of the body. To quote Hunter, he says: “It is an invariable
effect, that when any part of an animal is irritated
to a certain degree, it inflames and forms matter, the intention
of which is to remove the irritating cause. This
has been before stated; but it is common only to secreting
surfaces; and when the same cause is applied to non-secreting
surfaces, ulceration is set up. This is not only
the case in common irritation, but also in specific cases, as
in syphilis, burns,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to explain how a chancrous
sore is produced. Surmises are at our service, and those
which are founded upon certain facts are the more likely
to be true. For instance, a person receiving syphilis must
contract it from another individual having it. The mere
solitary act of coition will not spontaneously produce it,
provided the party be clean, for that surely is not an excess;
but having connexion with an infected one, and
thereby exposing a healthy surface to a diseased one, becomes
an infraction of one of nature’s laws. Well, the
patient contaminating the other must have a chancre,
which giving off, by contact, its morbid secretion, produces
a specific result, namely, a small pimple.</p>

<p>In men, the disease is generally contracted upon the
frænum, glans penis, or prepuce, or upon the common skin
of the body of the penis, but most frequently upon the interior.
From the peculiar and alterable structure of the
penis and its prepuce, the poison, unless well washed off,
is apt to lodge in the folds thereof, and sooner or later it
manifests its influence, which may occur in twenty-four
hours, or may be withheld for months. Generally, however,
seven or eight or nine days puts the patient out of
suspense. The first symptoms consist in an itching, succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
by a redness of the part, out of which is soon observed
to spring up a small elevation or pimple. In connexions
where haste, disproportion of size, or much excitement
or excess prevails, an absolute abrasion of the
skin often takes place, and the parts where such occur are
generally the everted portion of the prepuce, or the frænum
of the same.</p>

<p>The accompanying drawings represent the extent of the
redness and the first appearance of
the pimple. The upper diagram
alludes to the irritation and excoriation
around the frænum, and the
lower, the first evidence of a chancre.
I am describing the most common
form of chancre, such as is
known in the profession as Mr.
Hunter’s chancre. A perceptible
hardness next ensues round the pimple,
which becomes more elevated
when it ulcerates, or, in other words, the head gets broken
off and a little hollow is left. The tumor
(for such it may be called) is generally
of a limited circumference, seldom
exceeding the size of a silver penny,
unless in an advanced stage of the
disease. When a chancre attacks the
frænum, and undermines it, as it were,
the frænum is often destroyed; and of
course, with its destruction, departs its
property of controlling or of directing
the orifice of the urethra in urinating, or in the emission
of the semen.</p>

<p>This drawing exhibits three ulcers:
one on the prepuce, another under the
frænum, having eaten its way through,
as marked by the black cross-line, and
the third situated on the glans.</p>

<p>When the pimple appears on the
outside of the prepuce for instance, it
assumes generally a larger form, and,
as the head is broken off, crust after
crust rises up, until the process of ulceration has very far
advanced, or the applications that are generally employed
prevent its re-formation. In the former instance, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
crusts are attributable to evaporation of the discharge; in
the latter, their absence is already explained by the prevention
of the same. There is such a thing as sympathy
in eruptive disorders. In skin affections of the corners of
the mouths of children, we often see the inflammation
cross from corner to corner. The same is observable
where the attacks comprise the angle of an eye. So is it
with the penis, a structure equally as delicate; and accordingly
the edges of the prepuce often put on a jagged
appearance resembling chaps on hands.</p>

<p>Witness the above wood-cut. It portrays an
ulcer somewhat diffused on the
prepuce, and the ragged edge of
the same structure. The sketch
just introduced was taken from
a patient perhaps only a fortnight
old with the disease. Being
a rackety, dissipated young man,
and regardless of the treatment
suggested, a week’s neglect produced
the following <span class="nobreak">alteration:—</span></p>

</div>

<p>A new ulcer sprung up, the old
one increased in size, and the entire
edge of the prepuce became
involved in the irritation.</p>

<p>Phymosis and paraphymosis
occur in syphilis as they do in
gonorrhœa. The treatment is
the same in both. Warm, soothing
applications are indispensable;
and occasionally, to prevent
adherence between the glans and
prepuce, the scalpel must be had
recourse to. I have already expressed
my conviction that the progress of the disease rests
as <i>much</i> or <i>more</i> upon the condition of the party receiving
it, than the specific property of the complaint.</p>

<p>“If the inflammation spreads fast and considerably, it
shows a constitution more disposed to inflammation than
natural; if the pain is great, it shows a strong disposition
to irritation. It also sometimes happens that they begin
very early to form sloughs; when this is the case, they
have a strong tendency to mortification. Bleeding is also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
a consequence owing to exposure of the ulcered <i>corpus
cavernosum</i>.”—<i>Hunter.</i></p>

<p>The reader will recollect that it has been stated that
chancres, like the many symptoms of gonorrhœa, differ in
their characteristics. Quoting from authorities, and, as
will be further illustrated, the following may be taken as
the summary of the most prominent <span class="nobreak">appearances:—</span></p>

<p>The ordinary chancre is characterized by a hollow centre,
a hard and ragged edge, a yellow surface, with a deposite
of tenacious matter, and a red and inflammatory
margin. There is also a hardness felt at its base on taking
the part up between the fingers. This has already
been shown; but as illustrations multiply, the possessor
of this publication, especially if he be an invalid, will
recognise the annexed. It exhibits the
ordinary chancre on the inner part of
the prepuce, the glans, and the orifice
of the urethra—no unfrequent seat of
chancre.</p>

<p>Many ulcers assume a very indolent
form, and remain quiescent for a long
period. One patient I knew, who consulted
me for rheumatism, and who disavowed
ever having had syphilis. He
took vapor baths, which assuaged the pain, but did not remove
it. Accident discovered to me the existence of a
sore on the penis, by observing the dressings of the same,
carefully placed on the corner of the mantel-piece in the
bath-room. The following was the appearance of the
sores. He had endured them for
nearly three months, nor had he perceived
much alteration, either for
better or worse. The disease was
properly healed, and he soon got
well.</p>

<p>Another kind is one denominated
the superficial, with raised edges. It
is more frequently seated at the upper
part of the prepuce, and creating
a thickening of it, ending in phymosis,
which lasts a long time after the
cure of the ulcers. This kind of chancre is sometimes
very obstinate, and continues many weeks. The following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
illustration portrays its presence near
the edge of the <i>corona glandis</i>.</p>

<p>There are two other kinds of sores
called the <i>phagedenic</i> and <i>sloughing</i>
ulcers and chancres.</p>

<p>The phagedenic is a corroding ulcer
without granulations. It is also
destitute of any surrounding induration,
but frequently its circumference
is of a livid red color. When the disease is injudiciously
treated, the whole of the penis will be destroyed in a very
short time. The absence of coloring detracts from a faithful
representation of the kind of sore just alluded to. The
drawing is sketched from Mr. Skey’s work on Syphilis.</p>

<p>I have witnessed the sloughing, or, in other words, the
loss of the entire top of the glans and prepuce, within half
a dozen days. The subjoined drawing (overleaf) represents
a tumefied state of the penis, ulceration on the glans
surrounding the orifice of the urethra, phymosis of the prepuce,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
and ulcers in different
stages on the outside thereof.
The sketch was taken from
Wallace’s work. Such are
often met with. Chancres,
as before stated, often become
irritable, spread rapidly, and
slough, more particularly in
persons of intemperate and
dissipated habits, or when the
case has been improperly
treated; and openings into
the urethra are formed to a
considerable extent, sometimes
to the destruction of the
glans, or a portion of the penis.</p>

<p>Warts are often met with, as in gonorrhœa,
and, like those, will arise from
simple local irritation, from the accumulation
of the natural secretions, or
want of cleanliness. They are hard
and soft, and require different treatment
accordingly. They are not contagious;
that is, they do not communicate
a venereal affection, but they
very readily produce a similar disease
in parts they come in contact with.
The story is here well told by the engraver’s
aid.</p>

<p>It often happens that
the ulceration appears checked. A
tumor (see next page) will form,
and the surface will look very red
and angry—will even yield a moisture,
and finally disappear. I say
finally, because it frequently proves
very obstinate, and trespasses upon
the patience and forbearance almost
to induce despair. It usually is very
irritable, the itching being most troublesome. The illustration
was taken from a patient who had been an invalid

<p>After a certain time, varying
in proportion to the
virulence of the disease,
the poison is conveyed by
the numerous absorbents
(which run from the penis)
to the glands in the groin,
one or more of which become
inflamed and enlarged,
producing that well-known
swelling, already
alluded to, called <i>bubo</i>. Ulcers,
too, are sometimes
situated within the urethra,
as is seen in the annexed
cut.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">OF BUBOES.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Surgeons</span> apply the word bubo to inflamed glands from
syphilis, wherever they happen to be. The body abounds
with absorbents, which are small delicate vessels that form
a net-work over the entire surface, and exist also in every
structure. Their purpose is to convey the nutriment to the
circulation. They form <i>stations</i>, as it were, or points of assemblage;
and these are generally situated in the angles of
the body—the groin, the armpits, hams, neck, &amp;c.—parts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
most protected from injury. When skin inflammation is
present, to familiarize the meaning, the nearest glands
sympathize and swell; as, for, instance, who has escaped
a swelling, at one time or other of his life, in the neck,
throat, or armpits? When a sore prevails on the penis,
or a gonorrhœa exists, there most frequently ensues an enlargement
of the glands of the groin. The result of that
enlargement depends upon the nature of the inflammation.
In gonorrhœa it is merely temporary, not being sufficient
to provoke suppuration, or the formation and discharge of
matter, or very rarely so; but in the case of venereal ulcers,
where the inflammation is so conveyed, the escape
from such consequences is as seldom.</p>

<p>The mode which nature adopts to transfer the poison is
as inexplicable in its operation as the production of a
swelled testicle. Buboes (herein meant), then, are—or I
should say a bubo is—a specific inflammation of the glands
of the groin. It usually occurs on the same side of the
body as the ulcer is situated; but when the ulcer is seated
on or under the frænum, there seems to be no fixed rule
which side shall have the honor. Another peculiarity is,
that they more readily spring up from ulcers on the prepuce
than on the glans, and are more attributable to ulcers
than merely inflamed surfaces. They do occur sometimes
without either being apparent. To facilitate the clear understanding
of what we are talking about, a drawing is
presented of the inguinal glands,
and the absorbents leading to and
from it, which conveys but an imperfect
idea of the number of the
absorbents; but it serves to show
the nature of them, and their
mode of communication.</p>

<p>Glands become inflamed from
other causes than syphilis; a
scratch, a bruise, or any local irritation,
will occasion an enlargement
of the nearest set of glands,
or at least one of them. Scrofula is a specific cause. As
the venereal poison carries with it its morbid nature wherever
it happens to be conveyed, the glands become infected
with it; and hence it is the more readily transferred to the
system at large. Very frequently and fortunately the disease
terminates <i>in</i> the glands; that is to say, does not extend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
to the circulation at large. The time that intervenes
after absorption has taken place, before bubo manifests itself,
is as uncertain as that of chancre appearing after
connexion; but generally the party is safe a fortnight after
the entire disappearance of the chancre. Where it is otherwise,
some trace of irritation on the glans or prepuce is
discoverable upon close investigation, or it will follow
great fatigue, venereal excesses, &amp;c. If the disease extend
to the constitution, it rarely affects other glands than
those primarily attacked; and hence it is rare that more
than one gland becomes inflamed. Having given the received
notions of the cause, the symptoms should next be
described.</p>

<p>No person can be unaware of the approach of a bubo.
There is seldom much advance of a swelling without pain,
which latter may be said to attract the patient’s attention
to the part, when a tumor, possibly the size only of a
horse-bean, is discovered. If the swelling be venereal, it
rapidly increases in size. It is at first moveable, but soon
feels as though firmly fixed. There is next experienced
inconvenience in walking. If the disease proceed to suppuration,
a continued throbbing is felt in the part, which
also swells, assumes a diffused redness, and at last an evident
sense of fluctuation is perceived. It may be ushered
in with a shivering fit. The skin becomes thin and tender,
and a conical point protrudes, which, unless punctured,
bursts and emits its contents. It is astonishing
what immense destruction of parts takes place in large
buboes. The theory how solids become converted into
fluids—how muscle, fat, and cellular membrane, become
absorbed, and a thick purulent secretion deposited, is fitter
for a work addressed exclusively to medical men than to
the public; and it therefore must suffice that such happen,
and few persons are ignorant of the fact; but the <i>modus
operandi</i> may at best be but the subject of conjecture.</p>

<p>The artist’s graver has pencilled a faithful picture (see
next page) of the appearance of the disease in question.
On the right side is represented a bubo that has broken,
or discharged its contents, and which is in a state of healing;
on the left side a bubo ready to burst; and, by way
of economising space, the left testicle is exhibited in a
state of varicocele, by no means an unfrequent accompaniment
to the previously narrated condition, but at the
same time by no means a necessary attendant, it being a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
totally distinct affection. Buboes present more varieties in their
size, and duration, and consequences, than they do on their initiation.
Cases in corroboration will be found in their proper place.</p>

to the disease of bubo explains the mode of inlet.
Like gonorrhœa and primary syphilis, it is often a very
complicated complaint. Secondary symptoms are admitted
to occur without being preceded by any primary form,
as, for instance, by immediate absorption unattended with
the irritation which accompanies chancre, or attendant
upon bubo; but where one secondary affection arises without
the primary, at least many hundred arise subsequent
to it; and unless, in the latter instance, treatment, and
vigilant too, is adopted, not one in a hundred escapes
them.</p>

<p><i>Lues venerea</i> (a synonymous term with syphilis) is supposed
to be imbibed from a very sensitive glans penis, a
simple abrasion of the skin of that organ, an ordinary ulcer,
or it may be transferred by inoculation. The late
John Hunter is certainly the most eminent authority—the
<i>vade mecum</i> of professional men. In these matters he
was a man of indefatigable perseverance and untiring observation.
Few new lights have been thrown on syphilis
since his time, except on the treatment, which has become
wonderfully simplified.</p>

<p>In thus again adverting to Mr. Hunter’s name, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
chiefly to observe, that the basis of my own thoughts and
practice has been built upon his writings; and therefore,
in being thus explicit in describing syphilis and its multitudinous
varieties, the reader is assured that what is here
written is, at all events, well founded, and not compounded
of the many new adventurising propositions of the day.
Mr. Hunter considered that contamination took place
about the beginning of the local complaints; that no person
was safe from lues while the original sore was present,
and not under treatment; but that, if the seeds of
lues were not already implanted in the constitution, the
consequences might be averted by treatment. Children
are born infected with lues, which they derive from their
parents; for instance, a man laboring under secondary, or
primary symptoms, cohabits with a healthy female, the female
<i>may</i> escape both diseases, but the child may inherit
them.</p>

<p>Instances have been known of children so infected, conveying
the disease to the wet nurse, to whose care they
may be removed; and, like other infectious disorders, the
complaint may be diffused <i>ad infinitum</i>. There is an impression
abroad, that, like consumption, healthy persons
are obnoxious to the breath and perspiration of the afflicted;
but, as in many other conjectures, corroboration is
wanted to prove the fact.</p>

<p>Syphilis is divided into primary and secondary; but
modern pathologists add a third stage, called tertiary
symptoms. Hunter used to divide lues into two orders;
the first was the most frequent form of the complaint, after
chancre and bubo; the second, the remaining symptoms.
The former consisted of the affections of the skin,
throat, nose, mouth, and tongue; the latter, the bones
and their coverings, called the periosteum and the fasciæ
of muscles, as explained in the preliminary part of this
publication. Lues does not always exhibit itself according
to this arrangement; which circumstance explains
that the occurrence is more owing to conditions of health,
and peculiar tendencies of the structures involved to receive
the contamination, than to any properties of the animal
poison.</p>

<p>He considers, also, that the development of the disease
depends much upon the state of weather, and the care the
patient may bestow upon himself; cold being a formidable
predisposer to the extension of secondary symptoms, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
that the parts least protected are generally the first to become
diseased. Hence the throat usually exhibits a morbid
action before the skin, furthermore, upon the cure of
the more superficial parts of the body; and, therefore,
suddenly suspending treatment, the symptoms manifest
themselves in the deeper seated. The deduction from this
statement is, a necessity for especial care in the clothing
of the body, and the continuance of the treatment some
little while after all external evidences of the complaint
have disappeared.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunter considered that the disease may be engrafted
in the constitution, and remain dormant for a considerable
period, through the parts not being brought into
action by any of the aforementioned causes. Ordinary illness,
simple fever, excess, fatigue, and a host of other occasions,
may excite a particular structure into a morbid
condition, when the hitherto dormant disease will sprout
out. His arguments are supported by numerous cases
wherein <i>several years</i> elapsed between the primary and
secondary symptoms, although no new infection was contracted
in the intermediate time.</p>

<p>Mercury was Mr. Hunter’s sheet-anchor; his faith in
it was to the effect that it would cure every stage of the
disease, but that one course of it, although it might cure
chancre, would not prevent secondary symptoms. They
might not occur, because the poison may not have been
carried into the circulation; and in like manner the second
stage of the disease need not be followed by a third.
But he considered that, when the several forms of the disease
betrayed themselves, their origin must be traced to a
general contamination of the system at the same time.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="no-page-break">OF THE SYMPTOMS OF THE FIRST STAGE OF LUES.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Six</span> weeks is the time usually allowed to elapse between
primary and secondary symptoms; but it is not invariably
the case, instances having occurred where the disease has
embraced, and most severely, both stages in a fortnight,
and others between which a much longer time has existed.
The first symptoms of lues consist either of a sore throat
or a spotted skin. When the skin is the seat, a red spot,
not unlike a flea-bite, is perceived; the color soon dies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
into a brownish or copper-colored hue. Occasionally, at
the outset, a small pimple is observed, which breaks and
scurfs; the coppery-colored spot next feels rough, and a
kind of scurf will exude that after a few days falls off to
make way for more. The disease being more usually slow
than rapid in its progress, weeks may be consumed before
ulceration occurs, and merely a discoloration of the skin
is seen in spots seldom exceeding the size of a sixpenny or
fourpenny piece. Some of these spots will nearly disappear,
leaving a faint scar, and new ones will spring up.
The entire body may be covered with them, but usually
those parts nearer the centre of circulation generally possess
the most—such as the chest, neck, shoulders, arms,
wrists, hands, and head. As the disease progresses, the
scurf on the spots accumulates, falls off, re-forms, getting
thicker each time, when upon being detached, for they
cling now more closely, a sore and moist state of the skin
is observable. This may be covered with a new crust, or
may at once proceed to suppuration.</p>

<p>When an ulcer is formed, it will sometimes spread rapidly,
and embrace a patch the size of a crown-piece, when
the process of ulceration will assume the vigor of disease.</p>

<p>The accompanying sketch portrays, perhaps, more the seat of the
disease when attacking the upper part of the body, than the appearance;
for to give a true portraiture, the drawing should be the size of life,
and colored after nature. It is, however, I doubt not, sufficient to
exemplify the site of the disorder. The eruption is smaller on the
face, and less vicious, generally, than on the body; but it proves most
unsightly, and indicates great advancement of the disease. The legs
(see next page), and those parts of the skin least vascular, assume a
mottled appearance resembling recent bruises; at other times, clusters
of spots like grapes hanging together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>The shoulders, arms, and wrists, also present a somewhat similar
appearance; though perhaps not to the same extent, owing to being more
warmly clad, and less in exercise, than the lower extremity.</p>

<p>When the disease extends to the hands, it is marked by exfoliations
of the palm, with occasional deep cracks that cause much pain. Nor
are the fingers and nails exempt from this encroaching malady, which,
during its occupation, shows itself by a redness under the nail, that
at last ends in the destruction of the nail.</p>

<p>The head, also, is a frequent seat of the disorder. It is
generally discovered by running the hands through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
hair, when a little crust will be detected by the fingers, or a slight
itching will show its position, or the brush may break it off. The
top and hind parts of the head are generally the situations selected.
Occasionally the hair will fall off, leaving spots of a smooth
baldness.</p>

<p>The vital organs, fortunately, are never subject to syphilitic
inflammation—such as the brain, the viscera of the chest, and abdomen;
nor is even the mucous membrane of the interior of the body affected,
its power being confined solely to those parts or structures subject to
the influence of external causes.</p>

<p>When the venereal virus attacks the throat or palate, the membrane
of the roof of the mouth becomes red and inflamed, patches ulcerate,
and, if not cured, sooner or later expose the bony palate, which may
be felt by the probe. This is the first stage. The exposed bone next
exfoliates, and a communication is thereby formed between the mouth and
nose, the fluids return through it, the voice is changed into a nasal
twang, and a most offensive discharge is secreted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 275px;">

<p>This drawing represents ulceration of the tonsils, uvula, and arch
of the palate; also the edges of the tongue. The drawing, p. 102, shows
the under surface of the tongue, the inner part of the lower lip, and
the lower gums affected with venereal ulcers.</p>

<p>When the tonsils are attacked, ulcers appear, precisely similar in
character to chancres, hollow in the centre, with raised ragged edges,
yellow on the surface, with a livid color on the surrounding margin. A
sense of dryness is perceived, extending up the eustachian tube to the
ear. Sometimes the tongue, gums, and inner part of the lips,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
are attacked (see representation).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">

  </div>
</div>

<p>In the progress of the disease, the pharynx, or top of the gullet,
is brought under its influence, and the ulceration spreads through it
to the vertebræ or back-bone. Extending its course, it next attacks the
larynx, or top of the windpipe, when, if not arrested, it will soon
destroy life. Attending this affection of the larynx, there is always
loss of voice—the patient speaks in a low whisper. It is more fatal
than any other form of the venereal disease.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane of the nose stands next in order,
as subject to the influence of syphilis. The patient’s attention
is first directed to it by an incrustation which forms
in the nostril. On this being removed, a quantity of blood,
mixed with purulent matter, is discharged. In two or three
days, similar incrustations are formed, and under them
ulceration takes place, which frequently lays bare the bone,
and occasions it to exfoliate; and this exfoliating often
continues after the venereal action has ceased. The number
of bones which come away is often very considerable,
and horrible deformity is the result.</p>

<p>The periosteum and bones become in their turn affected
by swellings called nodes—the periosteum first, and the
bones subsequently. Of these, the cylindrical, being most
exposed to vicissitudes of temperature, are commonly the
first attacked. Those which are much covered by muscle
are rarely affected, as, for instance, the back part of the
<i>tibia</i>, or large bone of the leg, while nothing is more common
than to see nodes on its anterior part, which is only
covered with skin and periosteum. They occur on the
<i>fibula</i> only when it is slightly covered, and only on the
<i>ulna</i>, or elbow-bone, when similarly circumstanced. Nodes
on the <i>os humeri</i>, or shoulder-bone, except on the outer
side, are of very rare occurrence, but are frequently found
on the <i>clavicle</i>, or collar-bone, at its scapular and sternal
articulations.</p>

<p>In the following wood-cut is an illustration of the most
frequent situation of nodes on the forepart of the tibia, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
chief bone of the leg. The swelling is considerable; the
upper one proceeding to suppuration,
and the lower indicating merely a
tumefaction of the lower part of the bone,
near the instep.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em">
  <img src="images/i_b_103_cropped_112x400.jpg" width="112" height="400" alt="Described in surrounding text" />
  <div class="caption">

  </div>
</div>

<p>The symptoms which mark the disease are as follow: The patient
experiences in the evening a sensation of pain in the bone which is
afterward the seat of the node. In the course of a few days, a swelling
appears in the evening, which disappears again on the following
morning. It is excessively painful and tender at night, but in the
morning it is hardly perceptible, and the tenderness is almost gone.
At this particular period the periosteum is only affected; but when
the inflammation has continued some time longer, the bone is diseased
and becomes enlarged. The rationale is this: An inflammation of the
periosteum ensues. In a short time a deposite takes place between it
and the surface of the bone. This deposite, in the first instance, is
only a serous fluid, but a cartilaginous substance is soon secreted,
which is gradually converted into bone.</p>

<p>When attended to early, their treatment is very simple;
but occasionally cases of considerable difficulty will arise.</p>

<p>Large quantities of fluid will be found fluctuating between the
periosteum and the bone, which, when unaccompanied by redness and
inflammation of the skin, may be absorbed by proper treatment, but
which more usually is only curable by evacuation; and, unless great
care be used, exfoliation of the bone will ensue to a very great, and
sometimes fatal extent. The eyebrows, forehead, and temples, are often
the seat of fluid tumors varying from the size of peas and beans. Their
cure must be effected by absorption, or destruction of the bone is
often produced.</p>

<p>The flat bones are also subject to syphilis. The one
most commonly attacked is the <i>os frontis</i>, the symptoms
being just the same as those on the skin. The side bones
of the head now and then are affected; the os <i>occipitis</i>, or
back-bone of the head, very rarely; and the <i>os temporis</i>,
or temporal bone, being well covered with muscles, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
exposed to very little change of temperature, is never affected.</p>

<p>The <i>os frontis</i>, being the most exposed, is the most frequently
attacked. Suppuration sometimes takes place;
and when this has occurred on the front, it has happened
that the same suppurative process has occurred interiorly
between the <i>dura mater</i>, or the external membrane of the
brain, and the internal surface of the bone. The matter
presses upon the brain, and death is the consequence, if
the pressure be not removed by the use of the trephine or
trepanning instrument. This is a degree of severity to
which the disease rarely reaches now-a-days, from the
more extended knowledge and improved treatment of modern
times.</p>

<p>It must be observed, generally, of both these diseases—that
of the throat and nose, and this of the bones—that
they are oftener the result of improper treatment, such as
the excessive use of mercury, and exposure to great vicissitudes
of weather while under its influence, inducing what
is called the mercurial disease (which in fact is, or was, of
more frequent occurrence than the constitutional syphilitic
one), than the result of the natural tendency of the disease
in an otherwise healthy individual.</p>

<p><i>On the treatment of Syphilis.</i>—I consider it a fair presumption
that any invalided reader, except he be an accidental
one, of this book—by which I mean one, not having
<i>sought</i> its possession—must be acquainted with the association
of <i>mercury</i> and <i>syphilis</i>. If not, let him be told for
the first time, that such association exists as between
copaiba and gonorrhœa; or perhaps what may be rendered
more familiar to him, namely, as between <i>quinine</i> with
<i>ague</i>, or <i>colchicum</i> with <i>rheumatism</i>. That for upward of
three hundred years past mercury has been held an antidote
to venereal affections; and still is, in many forms of
the same, acknowledged indispensable for their removal.</p>

<p>From old notions afloat, that syphilitic patients to be
cured must be salivated to the extent of furnishing or filling
two or three wash-hand basins daily with saliva—that
the teeth drop out, that the breath becomes horribly
fetid, and that the consumer of the poison sacrifices one
third of his probable existence, even though he get well—the
greatest possible prejudice exists against mercury, and
the generality of uninformed patients have acquired a most
uncompromising dread of the remedy. From the frequent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
difficulty in getting patients to submit knowingly to mercurial
treatment, many new means have been caught up,
and some judiciously applied.</p>

<p>This new method has its advantages; but it does not
realize all that is promised. It consists in advising rest,
cleanliness, simple soothing applications, and, on the other
hand, mild astringent ones, a temperate diet, fresh air, an
easy mind, sarsaparilla, and other alterative medicines.
There are many believers in the efficacy of simplicity; and
the success that follows such treatment of nine tenths of
the ailments of humanity, bears out the usefulness of the
preceding methods; but the remaining tithe have alike a
claim upon our consideration, and of this tithe the syphilitic
invalids form a large portion.</p>

<p>The anti-mercurial advocates have, however, a salvo,
and admit now and then, an exception to exist, that particular
cases <i>do</i> require a mercurial course, but then it
should only be adopted in its mildest possible form, merely
with a view to act on the general health, rather than for
any specific property of its own. Again, there are books,
which are very elaborate, and what is equally important,
modern ones, written by talented men,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which still profess
faith in the curative powers of mercury, and employ it as
the chief agent in the cure of the venereal disease. Instead
of administering it to the same extent as formerly—instead
of attempting to produce salivation to the flow of
quarts—they merely aim at producing an impression on
the constitution; they are satisfied with a proof that their
patient is under mercurial influence: this is ascertained
by a coppery taste in the mouth, a slightly increased secretion
of saliva, and the presence of the accompanying,
but temporary depression.</p>

<p>Now the question to be resolved is, which of the two
methods is the correct one. The many forms of disease of
the sexual structures satisfy me, that their treatment should
be modified by circumstances; but I believe I am wise
enough to know, and certainly old enough to have observed,
that the severer forms of syphilis, and even the milder in
some constitutions, require the aid of mercury for their
cure; in fact, <i>will yield to no other plan of treatment</i>, thereby
admitting the <i>specific virtues</i> of the remedy.</p>

<p>The principles, therefore, which I advocate in the treatment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
of syphilis, are precisely those I depend upon in gonorrhœa,
or, to familiarize the analogy, in a fit of indigestion,
or an attack of local or general inflammation. Where
the health is disturbed, the first step is to attempt restoration.
The fact is almost too familiar to every one to need
repetition, that, as is the condition of the health, so is the
resistance it is capable of opposing to disease. The next
proceeding is, to attempt the subdual of the prevailing
symptoms. Syphilis, whether in the form of chancre, bubo,
or any of its secondary varieties, induces more or less fever,
inflammation, and interruption to the important offices
of digestion, and other vital processes, which consequently
require the promptest attention. Equally various are the
local indications of syphilis—the ulcers may be common,
superficial, phagedenic, or sloughing, each requiring various
treatment, as hereafter will be specified; but, above
all, too much reliance can not be placed on the dietetic
and physical regimen—two comprehensive significations,
which are, after all, the Alpha and Omega of the Materia
Medica. With this declaration, I pass on to the treatment
in detail of the more frequent and, I may add, leading features
of syphilis.</p>

<p class="noindent center brhide p1">———&lt;&gt;———</p>
<div class="section"></div>

<p><i>Treatment of Chancre.</i>—<i>Preliminary remarks.</i>—Chancres
are of various kinds. The most remarkable <span class="nobreak">are:—</span></p>

<p>1st. That characterized by its circular form, its excavated
surface covered by a layer of tenacious and adherent
matter, and its hard cartilaginous base and margin.</p>

<p>2d. Another form of chancre, unaccompanied by induration,
but with a very high margin, appearing often on
the outside of the prepuce, and seldom existing alone,
called, from the preceding description, the “superficial
chancre, with raised edges.” These kinds of ulcers are
sometimes very tedious, neither getting better nor worse,
but resisting every plan of treatment for their removal. I
have known instances where they have existed for several
months.</p>

<p>3d. The phagedenic chancre, a “corroding ulcer without
granulations,” and distinguished by its circumference being
of a livid red color. This is the kind of chancre that is
invariably rendered worse by mercury: indeed, cases have
occurred where, from the injudicious administration of that
medicine, the whole of the penis has been destroyed.</p>

<p>4th. A most formidable kind of chancre, denominated
the sloughing ulcer. It first appears as a black spot, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
spreads and becomes detached, leaving a deepened and unhealthy
looking surface. The sore is very painful, and encircled
with a dark purple areola. If neglected, or improperly
treated, the process of mortification goes on until
all the parts of generation are destroyed.</p>

<p>The last-named chancre is more often the consequence
of neglect on the part of the patient, than the natural
progress of the disease.</p>

<p>Now the usual method adopted by surgeons to remove
chancres, has been to excise them, or to apply caustic; the
latter is the plan I adopt, and would recommend; but all
chancres are not to be treated alike, some requiring antiphlogistic
remedies, others soothing, others stimulant.
Some practitioners rely entirely upon constitutional remedies.</p>

<p>On the first appearance of a chancre, I would enjoin an
alteration in the diet, regulating it according to the strength
of the patient. Abstemiousness should be the motto, avoiding
extremes, however, lest debility should be induced.
Quietude and rest, in the recumbent position, are two essential
adjuncts in the treatment of primary syphilis
throughout.</p>

<p>With respect to the treatment of the ulcer, characterized
by its circular form, excavated surface, and hardened base,
as detailed, the plan I almost invariably adopt is, immediately
on its appearance, at least as soon as the pimple has
broken or desquamated, to smear it with a hair pencil filled
with the solution of caustic, sometimes twice, at least once
a day (see Form <a id="FManchor_27"></a><a href="#Form_27" class="fmanchor">27</a>), and to keep it frequently washed in
the daytime with a lotion of the chloride of soda (see Form
<a id="FManchor_28"></a><a href="#Form_28" class="fmanchor">28</a>), or the black, red, or blue wash
(see Forms <a id="FManchor_29"></a><a href="#Form_29" class="fmanchor">29</a>,
<a id="FManchor_30"></a><a href="#Form_30" class="fmanchor">30</a>,
<a id="FManchor_31"></a><a href="#Form_31" class="fmanchor">31</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>If the patient be strong, and otherwise in good health, I
simply recommend a dose of purgative medicine, in anticipation
of any irritation that may arise. After which, I
suggest a middle diet to be adopted for the next few days.
From the sedative and salutary effects of the warm bath, I
recommend its employment immediately after the operation
of the medicine, and its repetition at frequent intervals.
Independently of its effect on the system, it is the best general
cleanser that can be resorted to. The subsequent
treatment is regulated by the result of the above, which
can be ascertained about the third day.</p>

<p>In numberless instances, and where the disease is thus
early detected and similarly treated, the mere continuance
of either the chloride lotion, or black wash, the middle diet,
an occasional aperient, the bath, with as much rest as possible,
are all that will be found needful to cure the disease,
which generally is effected in about a week or ten days at
farthest. From the universal dread that so sudden a disappearance
of the sore occasions, lest it should “be driven
into the system,” and from the apprehension that it is incurable
without taking mercury, I verily believe that, in
many cases, the practitioner, participating in the fears of
his patient, and anxious to allay them, reluctantly administers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
that mineral; and to such weak judgment may be
traced the relapses, or the occurrence of other symptoms
sometimes mistaken for secondary. Even when the case
terminates favorably, and within the space of time alluded
to, I would not be considered as recommending a sudden
return to free living; on the contrary, I would not release
the patient from the restrictions imposed upon his diet, exercise,
and regimen, for at least the same time as was occupied
in the cure, nor would I predict that, in every instance,
secondary symptoms should not ensue. Mercury
was supposed to possess some antisyphilitic property, inasmuch
that, when chancre healed during its exhibition, secondary
symptoms were averted. Facts, however, have
been wanting to corroborate that supposition; for secondary
symptoms have appeared despite the external and internal
employment of mercury, even to the extent of salivation.
Authors there are who attach similar properties
to other medicines, such as nitric acid, sarsaparilla, and
such like. Now, how do these medicines act upon the
system? Or what is their tendency of action? Why, by
increasing some particular function, such as the secretive
process of the salivary and other glands; by increasing
perspiration or absorption, &amp;c. The remedies whereby
these changes are induced are termed alteratives. I am
not going to deny that these, or some such changes in the
system, are unessential for the eradication, particularly of
morbid conditions of structure and function, dependent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
probably upon altered condition and diminished action in
others. On the contrary, they are the only antagonists to
disease which we possess.</p>

<p>But what I contend is, that, in our selection, we should
prefer those which produce most speedily and effectively
the desired change, with the least detriment to the general
health. And to this end, I invariably enjoin, where practicable,
warm or vapor bathing. I have elsewhere considered
this subject at length, to which I refer the reader;
but I will fearlessly assert that no one, or any plan of
treatment, will be found so effectual toward increasing
physical power to repel disease, or so permanently preservative
of health, as the modified employment of the
warm or vapor bath; and, therefore, in all cases of doubt
and apprehension, or independent of either, the use of the
warm or tepid, plain, or salt-water bath, two or three times
a week for a month, or the vapor bath about every fourth
or fifth day for the same period, is the best preventive that
can be adopted to avert secondary symptoms. Where
bathing of every kind is impracticable, as is the case in
some country places, and the same necessity exists, I advocate
the administration of alterative medicines; nor do
I object to the employment of mercury, where, under other
circumstances, without reference to its imaginary efficacy
in syphilis, it would be prescribed. But of this as we proceed.</p>

<p>Where, at the expiration of a week, the chancre neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
recedes nor advances, and is the only symptom present, it
is to be presumed that the condition of the patient’s health
has something to do with it, and that condition should be
minutely inquired into. There may be diminished or increased
appetite, with imperfect digestion; there may be
fever, with restlessness at night; there may be torpor or
irritation of the bowels; or the patient may consider his
only ailment to be the chancre, the irritation of which may
be found to arise from too active exertion. To whichever
cause it may be ascribed, the treatment should be directed.
In conjunction with local remedies, which may be varied,
alteratives may be given—five grains of the blue pill twice
a day; for instance, the Plummer’s pill in doses of five
grains every night, the occasional application of an active
aperient (see Forms <a id="FManchor_33"></a><a href="#Form_33" class="fmanchor">33</a>,
<a id="FManchor_34"></a><a href="#Form_34" class="fmanchor">34</a>), the decoction of sarsaparilla
(see Forms <a id="FManchor_49"></a><a href="#Form_49" class="fmanchor">49</a>,
<a id="FManchor_50"></a><a href="#Form_50" class="fmanchor">50</a>,
<a id="FManchor_51"></a><a href="#Form_51" class="fmanchor">51</a>). This plan, carefully pursued, seldom
fails in setting up a permanent cure. The patient
should be apprized of the vast importance of quiet, rest, and
abstemiousness; for, where they can be attended to, the
duration of the disease will be diminished one half; whereas,
he who is continually in the erect posture, and subject
to much walking about, who is indifferent to his diet, and
lives as free as formerly, incurs the risk of bubo, and all
its alarming consequences. Now, in no case or description
of chancre, do these remarks apply so aptly as to the
phagedenic and sloughing ulcer; in fact, they are applicable
to all, but more particularly the two latter, as they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
the result of already increased action. Mercury, violent
aperients, and other active remedies, should also be avoided
in these two forms of chancre; the local appliances should
be poultices of bread and water, linseed meal, and a solution
of opium, or poppy water; the sloughs or mortified
portions we should endeavor to detach, by the application
of a <i>smear</i> of nitric acid, or the chloride lotion (Form <a href="#Form_28" class="fmanchor">28</a>),
or stimulative ointment (Form <a id="FManchor_38"></a><a href="#Form_38" class="fmanchor">38</a>). The superficial sore
usually gets well by the same means as the ordinary
chancre.</p>

<p>Where the chancre is situated under the prepuce, and
the latter covering is so inflamed and swollen as to prevent
its being drawn back to exhibit the sore, the discharge
should be carefully washed out by any of the lotions already
recommended, by means of a syringe, several times in the
twenty-four hours. Much good is often done by varying
the local remedies, occasionally flouring or filling up the
ulcer with calomel, tutty powder, blue ointment, or in fact
any substance which alters the morbid action of the part;
but, as a general rule, the lotions of soda, lime, zinc, or
oxymuriate of mercury, will be found sufficient, if persevered
in.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of Bubo.</i>—Bubo I have already stated to be
an inflamed and enlarged condition of the inguinal (as its
name implies, signifying the groin), or, in fact, any other
gland, occasioned by the passage of the venereal poison
from the adjacent ulcer through it, preparatory to its contaminating
the constitution. But it is as well to know that
the system may become affected, or, in other words, the
poison may pass through the glands without involving them
in the disease, or that the poison may there stop, and be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
expelled as the bubo is cured. It is also observed, that
buboes are more frequently consequent upon an ulcer seated
on the prepuce than on the glans. Buboes are not always,
however, a sure criterion of the venereal disease, for they
will occur wherever irritation is superficial and adjacent.
Leeches applied to the temples will affect the cervical
glands, a graze or wound in the leg enlarge the inguinal,
and a whitlow on the finger, or any inflammation of the
hand or arm, will very often irritate the glands in the
axilla. In gonorrhœa, the glands in the groin become
swollen and painful, from sympathizing with the sensibility
of the urethra; but these and the preceding may, in general,
be distinguished from true venereal buboes by their
disinclination to proceed to suppuration; whereas, in
syphilis, that process runs through its several stages with
remarkable celerity, unless timely prevented. Buboes in
the groin are much more troublesome, and more likely to
betray the disease, than chancres, because they constitute
an augmentation to the patient’s suffering, seldom occurring,
unless preceded by a chancre, and because they occasion
a visible and necessary lameness. They also produce
more general disturbance of the patient’s health.</p>

<p>In the treatment of a bubo, venereal or not, the same
principles recommended in the section devoted to the cure
of chancre, should be followed in this instance—comprising
attention to the general health, and a subdual of the prevailing
symptoms.</p>

<p>In no form of syphilis is rest more essential than in bubo.
The patient will be apt to plead the necessity of following
his business, and the utter impossibility of staying at home;
that is his affair, mine is only to protest against exercise,
and urge the importance of rest, and even the recumbent
posture, and I can assure him, <i>that</i> alone will strip the disease
of three fourths of its terrors.</p>

<p>Certain local diseases produce more constitutional disturbance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
than others—among them may be classed buboes;
it would, therefore, be as impolitic suddenly and violently
to repel an inflammation of a gland or glands, without establishing
some outlet for the increased action to vent itself,
as it would be to check a flux or suppress an exanthematous
eruption, like measles or scarlatina.</p>

<p>If the bubo is, therefore, painful and inflamed, my advice
is as follows: Stay at home, and rest; descend to middle
diet; take some aperient; and should chancres alone be
present, and a treatment going on for their extinction, continue
the same; or, as bubo often immediately succeeds
the ulcer, and probably may be the first symptom noticed,
adopt, in addition to that recommended above the treatment
as advised for chancre, namely, the administration of
some alterative—for instance, five grains of blue pill every
night—or the Plummer’s pill every night—the aperient
powder every other day; and let the local treatment be directed
to remove the prevailing symptom, to subdue the
inflammation, and, if possible, thereby prevent suppuration.
It was formerly supposed that, unless buboes were allowed
to suppurate, the system could not escape the venereal
taint. Lower somewhat the vital powers, or, what may
be more intelligible, diminish the general inflammatory action,
establish some slight drain, by determining the secretions
to the intestines or skin: and buboes, even when
matter has absolutely formed, may be fearlessly absorbed,
which judicious treatment will effect, in nine cases out of
ten, without at all impregnating the constitution. To attain
this object, warm fomentations constantly applied, and
if possible the warm (hip or full length) bath every night.
When rest is determined upon, if the swelling is great, red,
and painful, leeches are eminently serviceable, but they
must be applied in numbers of at least a dozen at a time,
and repeated twice or thrice if necessary. Three or four,
by the irritation of the bites when healing, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
if the patient will not or can not remain quiet, only worry
and aggravate the disease. Where the inflammatory
symptoms are great, where there is fever and much heat
of skin, bleeding is the speediest and most effectual plan
to subdue them; and, in my opinion, it is to be preferred
before the trouble and bother of leeches. Where, however,
there is no remarkable excitement, local or universal,
the topical application of any of the ointments
suggested will often promote absorption (see Forms <a id="FManchor_35"></a><a href="#Form_35" class="fmanchor">35</a>,
<a id="FManchor_36"></a><a href="#Form_36" class="fmanchor">36</a>,
<a id="FManchor_37"></a><a href="#Form_37" class="fmanchor">37</a>).</p>

<p>Blisters applied over the bubo, very often disperse the
swelling. Pressure also, made by means of a pad covered
with tin foil (as seen in the subjoined cut), and continued
for several days, frequently urges the absorption of the
accumulated deposition in the gland.</p>

</div>

<p>Where <i>bubo</i> has been suffered to proceed, and the suppuration
appears inevitable, it would be highly improper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
to retard it: poultices and warm fomentations should be
applied, and when fit, an opening should be made to permit
the exit from, and prevent the extension of, the matter
in the surrounding cellular membrane; the operation
should not, however, be prematurely performed; the skin
should be permitted to become thin before an opening is
made, and that opening should be made in the most dependent
position, in order to allow complete escape of the
matter, lest fistulæ and sinuses should form. When an
abscess is thus established, its healing must be promoted
with all expedition, and care taken to preserve the
strength of the patient. For the former purpose, poultices,
mild healing ointments, or strapping plaster applied near
the edges of the wound, should be used. Poultices may
be applied with a bandage, as seen in the subjoined cut.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">

  </div>
</div>

<p>When the abscess appears indolent and not disposed to
heal, carrot and linseed-meal poultices may be substituted.
Astringent ointments should also be employed (see Forms
<a href="#Form_38" class="fmanchor">38</a>,
<a id="FManchor_39"></a><a href="#Form_39" class="fmanchor">39</a>,
<a id="FManchor_40"></a><a href="#Form_40" class="fmanchor">40</a>), or lotions (see Forms
<a id="FManchor_41"></a><a href="#Form_41" class="fmanchor">41</a>,
<a id="FManchor_42"></a><a href="#Form_42" class="fmanchor">42</a>), and the topical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
application of caustic to the edges of the wounds, or even
paring them with a scalpel. The occasional use of the
warm or vapor bath will give a healthy tone to the frame,
invigorate the depressed powers, and promote recovery.
The strength should be supported by more generous diet,
and any of the formulæ comprised under the head of tonics,
may be taken internally (see Forms
<a id="FManchor_43"></a><a href="#Form_43" class="fmanchor">43</a>,

<a id="FManchor_48"></a><a href="#Form_48" class="fmanchor">48</a>). As the patient becomes convalescent, change of air,
gradual exercise, the cold shower bath, or sea bathing, will
be of essential service.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of secondary symptoms.</i>—Secondary symptoms
usually appear from the sixth to the sixteenth week, but
are not unfrequently protracted beyond that period; they
are commonly ushered in with fever—a general sense of
being ill—a quickened pulse, headache, loss of appetite,
pains in various parts of the body, and restlessness at
night; in short, there is disturbance of all the vital functions,
until it is determined which structures are to be the
retreat of the common enemy. Some authors assign the
skin and throat as more liable to attack than others; but
I think the distinction dependant mainly upon the natural
or morbid idiosyncrasy of the invalid. At all events, the
inquiry here would be foreign to the design of this work,
and less useful than the advice, how best to combat the
evils when and wherever they occur. I have already
stated secondary symptoms to consist of eruptions, ulcerations,
and disfigurations of the skin, ulcerations of the
mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, and nose, pains
in the joints, swellings of the bones and their coverings,
and inflammation of the various fibrous textures of the
body.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of syphilitic eruptions.</i>—The cutaneous eruptions
of syphilis present considerable varieties, assuming
a scaly, papular, tubercular, or pustular appearance. Formerly
it was the opinion that no eruption was <i>venereal</i>,
unless characterized by a scurfy exfoliation, and teinted of
a copper color. This <i>test</i> is not now relied on. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
simpler forms, we find that the skin becomes mottled at
first, which appearance may partially die away and reappear,
deeper in color, and the spots become more numerous
in extent. The patient should be apprized that,
when the disease has progressed thus far, it is not in its
nature to depart unbidden; but it advances usually from
bad to worse.</p>

<p>The mottled dots enlarge, exfoliate, or scurf, or desquamate,
as it is called, leaving the subjacent circle thicker
and thicker, and of the same color as the cuticle which
peels off. In the ordinary uninterrupted progression, scabs
form, suppurate, and constitute an ulcer, like a chancre,
which ulcer assumes all the varieties of chancre. In other
cases, the eruption, instead of being scaly, “has a raised
surface, from which a whitish matter usually oozes.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">

  </div>
</div>

<p>The scaly copper-colored eruption, denominated, according to its
severity and appearance, syphilitic lepra or psoriasis, is regarded as
most characteristic of true syphilis, and is the most frequent. The
annexed is a drawing copied from nature; it is alluded to a few pages
further on: its pattern is frequently to be met with. A celebrated
writer, Mr. Carmichael, attaches considerable importance to the
character and appearance of the eruptions. He divides the venereal
disease into four species or varieties: 1st, the scaly venereal
disease, which he considers consequent upon the ordinary chancre; 2d,
the papular, consequent upon gonorrhœal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
ulceration; 3d, the tubercular; and 4th, the
pustular, he names from its appearance. These distinctions,
if correct, must be more interesting to the surgeon,
than serviceable to the patient, for the principles of
treatment must be alike in all. Now, although mercury
may be denied to possess any specific influence over the
syphilitic poison, either by its chemical action or neutralizing
power, except as a counter-irritant to the system, yet
the inability of nature to shake off the pestilential hydra,
unassisted by the weapons of the physician, is most apparent;
and the most powerful of which is, that class of
medicines called alteratives, none of which are more deserving,
none more manageable, if the least judgment be
displayed, than mercury.</p>

<p>The constitution, when under the influence of syphilitic
poison, is being led like a willing horse to its own destruction;
and unless the system be entirely revolutionized, that
event is not likely to be retarded. Here mercury<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
lend its powerful aid, and may be carried even so far as to
produce mild ptyalism or salivation. But there are instances
where mercury is inadmissible. The patient, however,
need not despair; extensive resources are still open
for him—the preparations of antimony,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the mineral acids,
sarsaparilla (Forms <a href="#Form_49" class="fmanchor">49</a>,
<a href="#Form_50" class="fmanchor">50</a>,
<a href="#Form_51" class="fmanchor">51</a>), iodine (Form
<a id="FManchor_52"></a><a href="#Form_52" class="fmanchor">52</a>), and a
host of others may be resorted to; and last, though not
least in importance, is the medicated vapor and fumigating
bath. From my connexion with an establishment of that
kind, my disinterestedness might be questioned in advising
the employment of bathing. As well might the apothecary
who deals in his own drugs, or the tradesman who vends
his own wares, be suspected of disingenuousness; the reply
I would offer should be, that the reader or invalid need
not pin his faith on my assertion, unless it so please him;
or if he does, may the onus lie at my door. But for his
sake, and to bear out my own assertion, I offer this declaration,
that, for the last twenty years, in conducting my establishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
(wherein more cases of syphilitic eruption have
presented themselves, than probably have fallen under the
notice of any other medical man in London within the
same period), no case, of which I have had the management,
has failed of being cured.</p>

<p>Where syphilitic eruptions terminate in ulceration, the
same local treatment should be used as advised for chancres.
Among the prescriptions will be found formulæ for
many useful topical applications, such as ointments, lotions,
and fumigations, for all the external developments of syphilitic
disease, with appropriate observations appended to
each.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of syphilitic sore throat.</i>—It has already been
mentioned, that the order of appearance of secondary symptoms
depends more upon the modified state of health than
any fixed law of disease. Syphilitic sore throat may precede
or follow the cutaneous eruptions; and it not unfrequently
happens, that all forms of the disease are present
at the same time: therefore, although they are here separately
considered, it will be found that the treatment corresponds
nearly in all, the only difference being in the local
applications.</p>

<p><i>Syphilitic sore throat</i> consists of ulcerations of the <i>fauces</i>,
<i>tonsils</i>, and <i>soft palate</i>. The inflammation begins in the
part affected. There is a redness, and sensation of dryness.
A small white spot is perceptible, which rapidly
spreads, is detached, reappears, and in four-and-twenty
hours, if seated on the tonsils, a cavity, as if a portion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
them had been scooped out, is observable. The ulcer has
a sharp margin, and its excavated surface is covered by a
whitish or yellowish adhesive matter. At other times, the
ulceration will be more superficial, but not less rapid in its
progress, extending over the upper part of the palate, and
back part of the throat. Here the general treatment is
precisely the same as in the other forms of the disease, viz.,
rest, abstemiousness, low diet, aperient, saline, and alterative
medicines, the blue pill, preparation of antimony, the
bath, and total exclusion from all excitement. The topical
treatment consists of fumigations, gargles, styptic lotions,
nitrous acid gas, blisters over the larynx, rubbing in of
any counter-irritating ointment; the object being throughout
to watch, and endeavor to improve the patient’s health,
support the strength, and mitigate and remove the local
symptoms.</p>

<p>In the affections of the nose and palate, the fumigations
are indispensable; injections must also be used, and styptic
lotions applied with a camel’s-hair brush. These cases are
very tedious, and, fortunately, in the present day, of rarer
occurrence than formerly; and the patient, thus severely
attacked, would be more prudent to rely upon some confidential
medical adviser, than to trust in his own management.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of venereal affections of the bones and joints.</i>—Nodes
are alleged, by medical men of great authority, to
be of rare occurrence, except the patient has been taking
mercury; but the observation is not always correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>Their treatment, of course, must be regulated by various
circumstances. When the pain and inflammation are severe,
leeches, bleeding, warm fomentations, or cold evaporating
lotions composed of vinegar and water, must be resorted
to. When they are chronic and painful, without
redness and inflammation, the greatest relief will be experienced
by the application of the ointment of iodine and
morphine (see Form <a id="FManchor_53"></a><a href="#Form_53" class="fmanchor">53</a>), also by the internal employment
of iodine in doses of five to ten drops twice or three times
a day. Where they are very obstinate, blisters will be often
useful in promoting absorption. When they ulcerate,
the treatment for chancres must be had recourse to. But
the most invaluable remedy, alone or in conjunction with
any of the preceding, is the vapor bath; it seldom fails to
give instantaneous relief. I have seen patients, who were
rendered almost insensible by the pain of nodes in the
head, chest, and other parts of the body, experience an entire
remission of the pain, and a diminution of the swelling,
by the application of one bath; and a course of six
or a dozen is rarely inefficient in effecting permanent recovery.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that rheumatism of the
bones and joints, and in fact of various parts of the body,
is unfortunately but too frequently an accompaniment or
a consequence of syphilitic disease: and an observer will
discover that nodes rarely exist without rheumatic inflammation
(of which by-the-by they are a species) being more
or less present.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">SECONDARY SYMPTOMS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the same manner as bubo, which is more usually preceded
by ulceration, but which may occur without it, secondary
symptoms, or that form of the disease wherein the constitution
is involved, may be carried into the circulation
without any local effect on the part to which the poison
was first applied being produced; or, in other words, secondary
symptoms need not necessarily be preceded by primary.
I have already stated that secondary symptoms are
also much modified, both as to the time, form, and severity
of their appearance, by the state of health of the patient
affecting and affected; and hence the varied degrees
of syphilitic maladies. By referring to past pages, it will
be seen that the mucous membrane of the throat and nose,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
the skin or surface of the body, and the periosteum and
bones, are the structures in which secondary symptoms develop
themselves, and accordingly I now proceed to their
several consideration in detail. To illustrate each of them
practically, I will first select diseases of the skin. They
consist of four marked species, distinguished as the scaly,
papular, pustular, and tubercular.</p>

<p>The most frequent form of eruption is the scaly, and
called syphilitic lepra. It is characterized by dry, flat,
and round patches, of different sizes, and of a coppery-red
color. Each spot is ushered in by a minute but hard elevation
of a purplish hue, that gradually radiates in size until
it acquires its limit. It then puts on a scaly appearance,
and, as it desquamates, with the exception of the centre,
which is sometimes left white, maintains its copper color.
These patches may be distinguished from ordinary leprosy
by their color, and their running on to ulceration, if uncontrolled
by medicine, and again by their more speedily
yielding to judicious treatment; when they become paler
in appearance, cease to exfoliate, and die away, leaving,
however, a coppery stain. Syphilitic eruptions occur in
all parts of the body, and are to be observed on the head,
face, back, legs, feet, hands, scrotum, &amp;c. (see wood-cut,
page 118), but they are much modified in their external
characters by the region they affect.</p>

<p>The pustular form of syphilitic eruption is also illimitable
as to situation and extent. The pustules, at the onset,
are scarcely to be distinguished from the patches of
lepra, being of similar color. They differ in size, some
being very large, and others very small. When they have
existed about a week, a purulent fluid escapes, which
hardens and crusts, constituting a conoid tumor, and surrounded
by a copper-colored areola. This crust after a
while drops off, leaving the under surface of the same teint
as the margin. The pustular form of the disease is mostly
consecutive to primary infection of the genital organs,
and is often complicated with affections of the throat,
nose, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Syphiloid tubercles ordinarily attack the face, more particularly
the nose, angles of the lips, ears, &amp;c. They vary
in size, are dispersed or grouped together, and are of a
purplish copper color. Like the pustular, they terminate
in ulceration, which on healing leaves an indelible scar.
This and other forms of syphilitic disease are very irregular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
in their attacks, first selecting one spot, then another,
then several together, so that the body presents often at
the same time many stages of the eruption. The papular
form of eruption is generally intermixed with the pustular
and tubercular. It is less strongly marked, but, like the
others, successive in its development, and usually complicated
with primary symptoms.</p>

<p>There is a form of cutaneous disfigurement, entitled syphilitic
exanthema, in which the skin is discolored by coppery-red
blushes that disappear under pressure of the finger.
There are also deep and painful fissures and
excrescences, called <i>vegetations</i>, from their resemblance to
raspberries, strawberries, cauliflowers, and leeks, observed
in syphilis, and most commonly they are to be found about
the lips, nose, eyebrows, chin, genitals, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It may not be unimportant to know that syphilitic eruptions
are contagious by inoculation, and that secondary
symptoms may be transmitted from one individual to another.</p>

<p>When I was a pupil of the London hospital, a woman
and her child presented themselves for treatment. The
mother was completely covered with copper-colored scaly
eruptions, obviously and unequivocally syphilitic. The
child also had venereal sore throat, and ulceration of the
mouth. The account which the mother gave of herself
was, that the eruption appeared a few weeks after her
confinement; and, upon further inquiry, it was discovered
that the husband had had a chancre of the penis: that
was cured, but secondary symptoms showed themselves
upon him. It was during the presence of the latter that
he had intercourse with his wife, at about the sixth month
of her pregnancy. The surgeon of the week gave it as
his opinion, that the disease was conveyed by the male semen
being absorbed by the mother, which was sufficient
to occasion the disease. The mother, husband, and child,
all submitted to mercurial treatment and fumigations, and
in a few weeks entirely recovered.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of Secondary Symptoms.</i>—Now in the treatment
of these cases, all of which are more than <i>skin deep</i>,
it is evident that, unless the cause which produces them
be expelled, all local repellants only exhaust the physical
energies of the patient; for the cure by such means but
provokes a speedier reproduction of the disease, and hence
the necessity of constitutional as well as topical remedies.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
I have fully explained my views regarding the employment
of mercury; and every day’s experience convinces
me that, where the constitution is imbued with the venereal
virus, there is no alternative but to employ the most
active alteratives, to effect a decisive and speedy change
in the state of the patient’s health. Various habits require
various preparations; the blue pill, the oxymuriate,
calomel, and the external application of the unguentum
hydrargyri fortius, are highly useful. I have, however, of
late, been in the habit of employing the proto-ioduret of
mercury, with unqualified success; nor do I limit its administration
to internal exhibition; it may be used externally.
The advantage of this preparation over others is,
that it rarely, if ever, produces ptyalism.</p>

<p>In old and inveterate cases, combined with the use of
the warm and vapor bath, both of which may be impregnated
with it, it has wrought wonders; and in cases that
had proved rebellious to every other means, although sedulously
employed, it had effected a speedy and decisive
cure. In the cure of an elderly person, covered almost
from head to foot with syphilitic ulceration, the internal
and external application of the proto-ioduret occasioned,
at the end of a few weeks, the entire disappearance of the
sores, leaving only a slight livid trace. In ulceration of
the throat, nose, and in fissures of the genitals, indolent
buboes, &amp;c., the success is no less remarkable than effectual.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">SYPHILITIC LEPRA.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> aged about 29 years suffered under the above
disease, and presented the following appearances and
symptoms: He was covered nearly all over with copper-colored
spots, the margins of which were both elevated
and red. The voice of the patient was rather hoarse, and
he complained also of a tenderness on swallowing: the
pain extended to the windpipe and tonsils (or almonds) of
the ear, as they are called. He experienced pain in his
limbs, which he described to be worse at night when in
bed. The spots on the skin every now and then desquamated,
or peeled, or scurfed off, leaving the cuticle red and
shiny underneath, and here and there the cutis was ulcerated.
On examining the throat, the swallow appeared
very inflamed, and the “pap” very pendulous. He was
hot and feverish, and acknowledged that he had had the
venereal disease about nine weeks ago, and for which he
had taken some medicines that he bought, and which had
cured him. When in bed, he complained of a burning,
tingling, and itching of the body, wherever it was covered
with the eruption.</p>

<p>The treatment was as follows: I bled him to the amount
of twelve ounces, and prescribed a strong aperient powder.
On the second day there was less irritation, and the
spots appeared less red. I advised him forthwith to take
a vapor bath, and repeat the same on alternate days for a
fortnight. I prescribed the pills as subjoined, and directed
one to be taken twice a day, to be succeeded by a dose of
the decoction of woods, as directed already.</p>

<p>Occasionally I order the patient to be placed in a mercurial
bath, of which there are several kinds, and which
can be administered either in the form of the fumigation
or in a fluid state.</p>

<p>After taking the bath, he could breathe with freedom
and comfort; he could also swallow without difficulty, and
he expressed himself much refreshed and invigorated.
Many of the eruptive spots on the body had exfoliated;
and he said he felt a conviction that he should soon get
well.</p>

<p>At the expiration of a week, when he had taken but
three baths, the soreness of the throat had left, the pains
in his limbs were all gone, and he slept well; the ulcers
had healed, and the eruption had nearly died away. I advised
a continuation of all the remedies; and after three
weeks of such perseverance, he was rewarded by an entire
recovery. The only alteration I directed to be made in his
diet was an abandonment of stimulants, such as wine,
spirits, or porter.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="no-page-break">NODES AND PAINS IN THE BONES.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> long-standing cases of syphilis, where either much
mercury has been taken, or the constitution weakened by
low living or careless treatment, a painful affection of the
bones, periosteum, tendons, and ligaments, frequently arises.
Where the inflammation attacks the bone or periosteum,
it usually exhibits itself in the form of a tumor, that
is at first hard and acutely painful, then becomes soft, and
does not always subside without ulcerating, and occasioning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
a tedious and unhealthy sore. These tumors are called
nodes, and are extremely rapid in growth, very uncertain
in their duration, and sometimes disappear as quickly as
they come. When the inflammation is seated in the ligament
and tendons, rheumatism is established. Both these
affections are very harassing to the patient; the pains are
severest at night, and wholly prevent sleep, the countenance
becomes sallow, appetite, strength, and flesh fail,
and hectic fever completes the list of troubles consequent
upon these forms of the disease. Nodes and rheumatic
pains may exist independently of, or in connexion with,
other syphilitic symptoms. Cases having already been related
of gonorrhœal rheumatism, which are analogous to
those proceeding from venereal absorption, any further detail
of such would be superfluous. The treatment should
also be conducted on the same principles in the one as in
the other.</p>

<p>The specific virtues of the vapor bath will be attested
by one trial. I have seen innumerable instances of immediate
relief from a single application. There are few forms
of syphiloid disease more distressing than these pains in
the bones; the patient is all but distracted with the agony
he endures. The relief he experiences from the vapor
bath surpasses belief; it verily appears to be magical. It
constitutes the best opiate we have.</p>

<p>Temporary relief, however, is not all that we want. It
is no use to remove the effect, and leave the cause behind.
The aid of medicine is indispensable. Formulæ of the
most appropriate remedies will be found among the prescriptions.
The general directions as to diet, regimen, and
clothing, dispersed throughout these pages, must be strictly
attended to. The stomach must not be at any time overloaded
with indigestible food. Milk diet is the best; milk
thickened with farinaceous food, mild tonics to restore the
tone of the stomach and impart strength, alteratives, sarsaparilla (Form <a id="FManchor_58"></a><a href="#Form_58" class="fmanchor">58</a>),
the old Lisbon diet drink, and all the suggestions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
hitherto offered with a view of improving the constitution,
should be carried into effect.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="no-page-break">SYPHILITIC SORE THROAT.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> period that elapses between the appearance of the
primary and secondary symptoms has already been stated
to vary from six weeks to six months; and some medical
writers assert that, if months may elapse, upon the same
principle years may, and therefore the patient who has
once been afflicted with the primary form of the disease is
never exempt from the liability of the secondary. That
syphilis, and diseases resembling it, do occur at every period
of life, is a fact of daily observation; and it is a matter
of less moment to know whether the invalid has ever
had chancre or bubo than is generally supposed, for the
treatment of every form of syphilis, and complaints putting
on like appearances, should be conducted on similar principles.
If mercury do possess anti-venereal properties, it
will be found no less obnoxious to ordinary sore throats,
ordinary ulceration, and cutaneous disfigurement. The
presence of any of the abovenamed diseases indicates a
habit predisposed to their occurrence; and that susceptibility
may be induced by a variety of causes, the most
prominent of which are those that debilitate the constitution,
such as syphilis itself, or the remedies exhibited for
its extermination, cold, fever, intemperate or impoverished
diet—all of which more or less abstract from, or derange
the distribution of, nervous energy. As in the cure
of these diseases, their removal depends upon an entire alteration
of the system, upon that principle alone should
mercury, or any other remedy be administered, not upon
its supposed specific neutralizing or annihilating antisyphilitic
power.</p>

<p>All this, of course, is a question of experience; and as I
profess that this work should convey the result of mine, I
do not hesitate to express my conviction that secondary
symptoms do present themselves years after a primary affection;
but at the same time I admit their more frequent
occurrence to be within three months; and, with regard
to diseases resembling the above, they are entirely independent
of such influences, and are the result of circumstances
from which no man is free. Of syphilitic ulcerations
of the throat, which are rarely solitary symptoms of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the disease, being usually accompaniments to articular
eruptions or rheumatic pains, there are several forms.
They are ushered in by feverishness, languor, and a peculiar
contour of the countenance, particularly expressive of
anxiety and debility. Of the first form of ulcerated throat,
and which is perhaps the least frequent, is an excavation
of the tonsil, with a tumid and red margin, accompanied
by a stiffness and uneasiness in swallowing. A more common
form, and which, from its occasioning little or no inconvenience,
is seldom discovered by the patient until it
degenerates into a worse state, is that where the ulceration
is more superficial, resembling fissures rather than
ulcers, and being situated at the back part and edges of
the tonsils, and low down the throat. From the absence
of pain and difficulty in swallowing, the medical man is
usually the first to detect it, when, on opening the mouth,
the throat—that is, the hinder part of the fauces—will be
discovered red and somewhat swollen; and on pressing
down the tongue with a spoon or spatula, the ulceration
will be apparent.</p>

<p>The last form—the phagedenic—is the most formidable,
both in symptoms and effects. It is characterized by fever,
and great pain and difficulty in swallowing, from the
beginning; all denoting acute inflammation of the throat.
The first appearance of ulceration is on the soft palate,
where a small aphthous spot is discovered, surrounded by
a deep erysipelatous redness, that proceeds rapidly to involve
the neighboring parts, which soon assume the appearance
of one extensive slough. This latter disease requires
prompt and active treatment, else the bones of the
palate and nose become implicated, exfoliate and occasion
a permanent deformity.</p>

<p>The process of cure in these cases must be regulated by
circumstances. In persons of full habit, blood-letting will
be requisite to arrest at once the inflammation. An active
purgative should also be taken; when, if the ulceration
resist these anti-phlegmonous measures, there is no alternative
left but to subject the system to the influence of
mercury. The proto-ioduret pill will be found the best
form, and the diet drink should be taken in conjunction.
The vapor bath, which can be medicated with poppies,
marsh-mallows, and ivy-leaves, or any other emollient
herb, will be found to ease deglutition, promote perspiration,
and afford ease. Local applications, such as gargles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>

<p class="p1">Ulceration of the larynx is an occasional consequence
of syphilis; but fortunately a rare one, as it is generally
fatal.</p>

<p>All the symptoms enumerated in this section have been
known to succeed gonorrhœa, and demand similar treatment.
The advocates for the analogy between gonorrhœa
and syphilis herein find a ready explanation for such an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
occurrence, which those adverse to the above opinion have

its rarity is no very substantial proof. Similar results
also transpire from the imprudent, or too free use of mercury.
The following case is a prototype of the many:— The
patient was a person about thirty years of age, and
was thus affected: there was considerable inflammation
in the entire back part of the throat; the tonsils were
excavated to some depth by ill-looking ulcers, the uvula
shared also in partial destruction; the tongue was swollen,
the tip and front part of it fissured, and on the left side
an irritable ulcer was apparent; the nose discharged a
disagreeable fluid, and occasionally gave off crusts of hardened
secretion. The body of this person, including the
head, was thickly sprinkled with venereal blotches of the
usual copper color. His health was much impaired, and
he stated the disease to have been of nearly twelve months’
duration from the first to the last.</p>

<p>The treatment consisted of the exhibition of mercury in
the form of the proto-ioduret, and the sarsaparilla. The
ulcers were touched with nitric acid, and submitted to
mercurial fumigation. At the end of two months he was
convalescent. In cases of ulceration of the throat and
nose, I have used the nitrate of silver, both in substance
and solution, with good effect.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">ADVICE TO INVALIDS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> now fully considered every form of syphilitic
disease compatible with the design of this work, a few
hints relative to the after-management of the patient when
relieved from his complaint, to guard against a relapse,
and to secure an entire restoration to sound health, may
not detract from its utility. There are many patients who,
on the disappearance of the more prominent symptoms of
their complaint, lose no opportunity of rejoicing in their
supposed recovery, and innocently commit sundry inapparent
irregularities, that throw them back to their former
state of suffering, which a little prudence and attention
might have prevented. The more severe the disease has
been, the slower, generally, is the recovery, and also less
permanent in its result. The mere subsidence of pain,
the healing of a wound, the disappearance of a cuticular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
eruption, or the suppression of a morbid secretion, are not
in themselves sufficient indications of substantial recovery.
The various physical and mental functions which,
during illness, are always more or less involved, have yet
to regain their tone. The digestive powers of the stomach
are easily deranged, and require watchful management
to secure the vantage gained. Equal care is essential,
lest the intellectual organs be too prematurely called
into active employment. Convalescence is often protracted
to an almost indefinite period, frequently from the most
trifling errors in diet. The stomach of a person reduced
to a low state of debility through a severe inflammatory
disorder, remains for a long time exceedingly sensitive,
and fails not to evince displeasure when oppressed with
indigestible, or too great a quantity of food. No cause
predisposes the patient to a relapse, or retards his recovery,
so much as inattention to diet. It is a popular error
to suppose that the weakness consequent upon severe illness
is only to be removed by rich and substantial food and
wines, and other stimulating drinks. Such indiscretion
often rekindles the disease, or predisposes the system to
the supervention of some other complaint. The change
from the sick-room to the parlor diet should be gradual
and progressive. The milk and farinaceous meal may be
varied by degrees to the milder forms and preparations of
animal food. Solids should be given at first in small quantities;
the diet should be rigidly adhered to, and in the
change from low to full diet, the intermediate one should
not be skipped over.</p>

<p>With regard to medicines, in no form of disease is it so
important, as in venereal affections, that they should be
continued for some time after the disappearance of symptoms.
Many a relapse of gonorrhœa and secondary symptoms
have occurred through the sudden abandonment of
the means adopted for their cure.</p>

<p>Exercise forms another important part of management
in convalescence; it should not be suddenly resumed, nor
should fatigue by any means be incurred. Early retiring
to bed, and early rising in the morning, tend considerably
to promote and preserve health. Warm clothing is very
essential and necessary for invalids.</p>

<p>The general signs of amendment are as follows: a reduced
frequency of the pulse, which is always accelerated
in acute diseases, the absence of thirst, a clean tongue, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
moist skin, a good appetite, and refreshing sleep; and,
lastly, all these are corroborated by an improvement in the
looks. The improved aspect of the countenance has
always been regarded as a sure criterion of returning
health.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">STRUCTURE, FUNCTIONS, AND DISEASES, OF THE FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> female genitals occupy the same relative situation
in the pelvis as the male, but they are an antithesis to each
other. The male are constructed to deposite, and the female
to receive; consequently, in the female there is a
conduit or passage, in place of the male penis, termed the
<i>vagina</i>, leading to the womb—the receptacle for the impregnating
fluid. The vagina is placed between the bladder
and rectum. Its entrance is marked by doublings, or
longitudinal folds of flesh, called <i>labia</i>, between the upper
part of which is the opening of the urethra into the bladder,
while below is occupied by the aperture, passage, or
fissure, as above described. At the roof of the vagina is
a fleshy ridge, with a pouting apex or point analogous to
the penis in the male, except being impervious, and called
the <i>clitoris</i>, which possesses the power of erection, or rather
of becoming intumescent when excited, and also of furnishing
a peculiar secretion. It is exquisitely sensitive,
and believed to be the seat of pleasure in the sexual embrace.
The vagina consists of a very soft, vascular, elastic,
and contracting structure, constituting, when its sides
are collapsed, liliputian rugæ, or ridges, like the impressions
left on the sand by a receding sea. Its surface is
lined by a delicate mucous membrane, which secretes a lubricating
fluid. It is this membrane which is the seat of
gonorrhœal discharge, fluor albus, &amp;c.; and it is also subject
to ulcerations and other diseases. From the clitoris
is suspended an inner fold, like a graceful mantle, called
<i>nymphæ</i>, which are also extremely sensitive, and appear to
serve, as they surround the urethra, also for the purpose
of directing the flow of urine. Under the opening of the
urethra, adherent to the external margins of the vagina, is
a membranous veil, or curtain, with a small central aperture,
called the <i>hymen</i>, the presence of which is looked upon
as a test of virginity. After the laceration or dilatation
of this membrane, which takes place through other causes
than sexual intercourse, the sides of it contract, and form<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
little wing-like slips, to which the fanciful name of <i>carunculæ
myrtiformes</i> is applied.</p>

<p>The subjoined diagram will familiarize the reader with
the situations of the female organs thus far given. It
exhibits a sectional view of the contents of the pelvis, or
lower part of the <span class="nobreak">abdomen:—</span></p>

<p>Much has been said regarding the presence of the <i>hymen</i>
in its entire state. It has been deemed by many to be
there placed as a moral evidence of chastity; but its laceration
is by no means an infallible test of dishonor. In
females of feeble or consumptive health, and others of delicate
constitutions generally, the aperture of the hymen
may become dilated from natural causes—from too profuse
a flow of the menstrual flux, from local debility of the part
itself, such as exist in the disease known by the name of
the <i>whites</i>; and it is sometimes to be traced to the habit
of personal and solitary excitement, as will be presently
alluded to. The membrane is occasionally so dense and
hard as to resist sexual cohabitation; and only upon dividing
it by the scalpel, can intercourse be sustained. At
other times it is so fragile and so vascular as to be torn
with the least violence, and profuse hæmorrhage to follow.</p>

<p>At the end of the vagina is the <i>uterus</i>. It is suspended
by what anatomists call its broad ligaments, which have
certain local attachments. It resembles in shape a pear.
It is of a peculiar structure, capable of great distension,
and possessing extraordinary properties. It is divided into
a body, neck, and mouth, and when unimpregnated, is
very compact, and occupies but little space. The interior
is consequently very small, and it secretes and pours forth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
at certain periods a sanguinous discharge, termed the <i>menstrua</i>.
When conception has occurred, the mouth of the
womb, which before was open, becomes permanently closed
until the period of delivery. Connected with the womb,
and constituting a most important part of its machinery,
there are discovered in the roof of the interior of the uterus,
two openings, which are the ends of two tubes or canals,
called the fallopian tubes.</p>

<p>These tubes have their origin in the <i>ovaria</i>, which are
two small bodies encased in the ligamentous band supporting
the uterus, and resembling the testicle of the male;
hence they have been called the female <i>testes</i>. These
ovaria contain a number of little vesicles of the size of
mustard-seeds, and some of the size of a pea, in number
from twelve to fifteen. These vesicles are denominated
the eggs of the human species. Annexed to the ovaria
are observed, surrounding the tubes, certain <i>fimbriæ</i>, which
grasp the ovaria during the copulative act, when prolific,
and squeeze out, as it were, one of these little eggs, and
propel it into the uterus.</p>

<p>Still further to facilitate the understanding of the structures
described in addition to the preceding diagram, the
following drawing is presented. It exhibits a section of
the female pelvis, and explains more fully the relative positions

<p>To particularize: The upper part is called the <i>fundus</i>;
the widest part, the <i>body</i>; the <i>neck</i>, the narrow part; and
the lower portion the <i>mouth</i>, or the <i>os tincæ</i>. The connexion
of the fallopian tubes is well shown.</p>

<p>The uterus, or womb, is described by physiologists as
being of a spongy structure—a structure that yields with
its enlargement—that grows with its growth—that resumes
the former size when disburdened of its contents.
It is supplied with blood-vessels, is duly supported, has
scarcely a cavity when unimpregnated, but is ever in a
state of preparation for changes. Of conception we shall
presently treat.</p>

<p>There is one function too important to omit in this
place, and this is menstruation—a term indicating a
monthly periodical discharge that escapes, or which is
given off, from the womb. At the commencement of this
function, woman is said to have arrived at puberty; but
there are cases of precocity, and others wherein it never
occurs, that neutralize this assertion; besides, menstruation,
being deferred or protracted, depends frequently upon
peculiarities of health. As soon, however, as it occurs, a
sensible change takes place in the female economy; and
certainly the other developments of womanhood rapidly
follow.</p>

<p>Menstruation is the monthly discharge of a red fluid,
common to females from fifteen or sixteen years of age to
between forty and fifty; and it is held that, while a female<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
menstruates, she is apt, and capable also, to conceive.
Menstruation is a device of nature to relieve the system,
or to preserve the balance of the circulation, from the non-fulfilment
of her intentions, by the absence of procreation.
It usually continues for four, five, or six days, and seldom
exceeds a few ounces. Its suppression is usually attended
with marked ill health, and many of the formidable complaints
of females are attributable to its irregularities.
When anticipated, the female encounters feelings of depression
and lassitude, and exhibits an aspect of feeble
health. As a physiological fact, women, before and after
menstruation, are more desirous of the exercise of sexual
privileges, and usually the approach of the menstrual flow
is accompanied by a sexual orgasm. It has ever been
deemed, by almost universal consent, prudent for married
persons and others to abstain from the sexual embrace
during that period. If only on the score of cleanliness, it
should be observed; besides, the likelihood of establishing
irritability, and the probability of interfering with this
healthful provision of nature, should deter from the indulgence.
In some countries, menstruating women are excluded
from associating with the other sex altogether, and
are even forbid mingling with household duties. At the
close of this article will be found a series of prescriptions
and suggestions for the removal of the various disturbances
this function is liable to.</p>

<p>The act of connexion is urged by what is called the sexual
propensity. It is accompanied by feelings of the intensest
kind: the acme of enjoyment is at the moment of
seminal ejaculation. The penis is excited to erection by
the influx or rush of blood into its cavernous or cellular
structure; the scrotum becomes constricted, and compresses
the testicles; the <i>vesiculæ seminales</i>, and the prostate
gland, are also elevated by the muscles called <i>levatores
ani</i>, as shown in the preliminary anatomical drawings,
whence their use may now be better understood, as well
as those of the perineal muscles, which all more or less
assist in causing the prompt and forcible ejaculation of the
spermatic fluid.</p>

<p>“In<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the female, the sense of enjoyment, <i>sub coitu</i>, appears
to be principally excited by the friction of the <i>labia
interna</i> and <i>clitoris</i>, which are alike in a state of turgescence
or erection. This nervous excitement, as in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
male, often reaches such a degree of intensity that a kind
of syncoptic state is induced.” A sense of contented lassitude
follows, and the mind is permitted to return from
the regions of excited imagination to its ordinary quietude.</p>

<p>The due occurrence of the phenomena just detailed does
not necessarily secure, although it generally succeeds in
producing, a prolific result. Health, aptitude, and one important
condition, are indispensable; and the last is—a
positive contact between the male sperm and female ovum.</p>

<p>There are many remarkable eccentricities that embitter
married life. A union may exist between two parties who
are wholly inapt for mutual enjoyment. The sensations
belonging to the sexual act are involuntary, and are provoked
independently of the will: hence, in connexion without
consent, or under feelings of great repugnance, the orgasm
is sometimes aroused; and yet, where the greatest
affection and desire prevail, the male oftentimes unseasonably
concluding before the female, is a most tantalizing
source of disappointment. Further allusions will be found
to this subject under the heads of “Sterility,” and “Impuissance.”</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>Man, unlike other animals, is not smitten with desire to
propagate only at particular periods. In sentient beings,
every season is favorable to the flame of love.</p>

<p>When conception takes place, the following phenomena
are believed to occur: The womb is supposed to participate
in the excitement of the sexual act, and at the moment
of the orgasm, to receive the male seed, and to mingle
with it a fluid of its own. The whole apparatus of the
uterus appears influenced at the same time,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> by a kind
of electric irritability. A vesicle, owing to the ovaria being
grasped or embraced by the fimbriæ, escapes from its
lodgment and enters the fallopian tube, where it bursts,
and its albuminous drop is conveyed into the womb.</p>

<p>From the circumstance of the male semen returning
from the vagina after copulation, it has been doubted
whether it was intended to enter the uterus. It certainly
can only enter once,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and that when impregnation takes
place; and even then a small portion suffices, for immediately
after conception the mouth of the womb becomes impermeably
closed. The mouth of the womb lies horizontally,
like the lips of the face, while that of the orifice of
the urethra is arranged perpendicularly: hence the presumption,
from this better adaptation to transmit and
receive, that the semen to impregnate should enter the
uterus.</p>

<p>This question is mooted, because it has been supposed
by some that impregnation ensues from the vapor or odor
of the male seed ascending to the womb. Contending
parties admit, while others deny, that the seed may be, and
has been, detected in the womb of females and animals
having been slain (or who may have died) during or soon
after the act of copulation. Impregnation has followed
very imperfect penetration, such as in cases of unruptured
hymen, or of disproportion of parts, and other causes needless
to insert here, by which the supposition is supported
that conception takes place from vaginal absorption; but
it must be remembered that the seed is projected generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
with great force, and that the smallest possible quantity is
sufficient for impregnation; also, that the vagina possesses
a constrictive movement of its own, whereby the seed
is carried into the womb.</p>

<p>After the escape of the “albuminous drop,” the vascular
membrane which contained it is converted into what
is called a corpus luteum; denoting thereby—for it assumes
the form, after a while, of a fleshy nucleus—that
the female has either conceived, or has been under the
influence of strong amatory excitement. This <i>salvo</i> must
be admitted, for corpora lutea have been discovered in females
where intercourse was even impossible; but as this
detection of corpora lutea generally corroborates the surmise
that so many conceptions have taken place as there
are corpora lutea, it is to be presumed that the exception
must be owing to some similarly powerful mental, as well
as physical excitement.</p>

<p>When impregnation has taken place, the womb begins
to enlarge, and become more soft, vascular, and turgid—the
wonderful process of fluids assuming the form of solids
commences, and within a fortnight an investing
membrane is formed, called the <i>decidua</i> (I will insert as
few names as possible), consisting of two kinds of folds,
one lining the womb, and the other containing the <i>ovum</i>
which has therein “taken root.” The ovum is now a soft
oval mass, fringed with vessels, and composed
of membranes containing the early fœtus. See
sketch.</p>

<p>When opened, the fœtus appears surrounded
by three distinct membranes: first, <i>the decidua</i>;
secondly, <i>the chorion</i>, the inner fold of the former; thirdly,
<i>the amnios</i>. The decidua, as before stated, lines the womb;
the two others cover the ovum or fœtus. After a time the
amnios and chorion become adherent to each other, and a
fluid is interposed betwixt the amnios and fœtus, called
the <i>liquor amnii</i>. The fœtus, as it advances, is perceived
to be hanging by an organized support, called the umbilical
chord, floating in the liquor before named.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>It will answer no practical usefulness to go through the
whole minutiæ of the various physiological changes that
take place relative to fœtal growth from the hour of impregnation
to that of delivery. What has already been
detailed, has been offered to unveil a little of that singular
ignorance that exists generally among non-medical persons
regarding the history of themselves. “Too much
learning is a dangerous thing;” and it will readily be allowed,
that a sufficient idea that certain things <i>happen</i> is
oftentimes as useful as to know <i>how</i> they happen, especially
when it belongs to a department requiring much
research, time, and ingenuity, thoroughly to understand,
and which may chance to be foreign to our ordinary pursuit.</p>

<p>The period consumed in gestation is forty weeks, or nine
calendar months, and the time is calculated from a fortnight
after the suspension of menstruation. Some married
ladies pride themselves upon being able to predict to
a day—to tell the precise occasion when they conceive,
and which they date from some unusual sensation experienced
at the particular embrace which effected the important
change. Many medical men disallow that such tokens
present themselves, and are opposed to the belief
which many mothers entertain, that nature is so communicative;
and also are skeptical of those extraordinary influences
that every day furnish proofs of maternal imagination,
occasioning to the burden they carry, sundry
marks, malformations, and monstrosities. Examinations
have found that the order of fœtal organization is somewhat
as follows: the heart and large vessels, the liver and
appendages, the brain, stomach, and extremities. The
determination of sex and number has hitherto defied exploration.
In the early months of pregnancy the womb
maintains its natural position; but as it enlarges, it also
emerges from the pelvis into the abdomen. The moment
of its slipping out of the pelvis is termed quickening, of
which most women are sensible—some fainting on the occasion,
others being attacked with nausea, hysteria, and
palpitation of the heart. Quickening usually occurs between
the fourth and fifth month. The fœtus is then
called a child—the law ordaining that, if a woman intentionally
procure, or such parties as may assist in so doing,
abortion or miscarriage before quickening, it is misdemeanor,
if after, murder.</p>

<p>A full pregnant female, like a very corpulent man,
walks very erect: hence the popular notion that ladies in
the one condition, and gentlemen in the other, do not think
meanly of themselves, but strut along well pleased with
their own importance. It is an uncharitable idea; the
attitude is unavoidable, the head and shoulders being
thrown back to counterbalance the protuberance in front—to
preserve, in fact, the centre of gravity, to save themselves
from falling.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms of Pregnancy.</i>—Mysterious as is the process
of impregnation, there are many forewarnings which, being
generally found correct, are useful to be known. Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
as are the changes that take place in the female economy
during child-bearing, and productive as they frequently
are of serious disturbances to health, it is benevolently ordained
that women who fulfil their destiny of becoming
mothers, have better health to sustain them through their
travail than the single or unprolific. The signs of pregnancy
during the first few weeks are very equivocal. The
first probability is the suppression of menstruation, which
is accompanied by fulness of the breasts, the nipples of
which become surrounded by a dark areola; headache,
flushing in the face, and heat in the palms of the hands,
ensue; also sickness in the morning, and probably an accession
of mental irritability; various longings exist—many
very ridiculous, others bordering on insanity, and
some indicating great perversion of temper, habits, in
hitherto well-conducted inclinations.</p>

<p>There are many phenomena more readily discovered by
medical men accustomed to the accoucheur’s employment
than describable, that indicate pregnancy; the sinking of
the abdomen, the descent and closure of the uterus, the
altered facial looks, the state of the pulse, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>From the fourth month, when the womb ascends into
the abdomen, the signs are more positive: the protrusion
of the navel, the evident enlargement of the belly, the tenderness
and fulness of, and occasional escape of milk from,
the breasts, clearly point out the occasion.</p>

<p>About the fifth month, the movements of the child are
very apparent to the mother, when all doubt is removed.</p>

<p>There are some conditions of female life that assimilate
to pregnancy, and which have defied the judgment of matrons,
and even medical men, but they are rare—such as
dropsy of the abdomen, or ovaries, tumors, accumulations
of wind, &amp;c. These, with the suspension of menstruation
(which last is but an uncertain sign, for it may depend
upon cold, fever, or inflammation), have destroyed the anticipations
of fond wives, and have alarmed those who desire
not to become mothers.</p>

<p><i>Parturition</i> takes place at the end of the ninth month;
but children born at the end of seven will live, and examples
are related of some that have “gone” ten. In France,
legitimacy is allowed to children born on the 299th day of
pregnancy.</p>

<p><i>Labor</i> is distinguished by a softening of the soft parts of
the female organs of generation, an abundant secretion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
of mucus, a relaxation of the mouth of the womb, and a
forcible contraction of its body. The expulsion of the
child is effected by pains of a straining nature. After the
birth of the child, the womb contracts to its <i>normal</i> or unimpregnated
size, giving forth a discharge, called the <i>lochia</i>,
that lasts for several days, and the breasts immediately furnish
the secretion of milk.</p>

<p>Previously to entering upon the consideration of the diseases
arising from infection, and for which this book was
originally composed, a word or two may be said upon a
condition of the womb, unfortunately of frequent prevalence,
called <i>prolapsus uteri</i>, or <i>falling of the womb</i>. Such
occurrence may take place with single females as well as
with married, or those who have borne children. It may
be held as the result of debility; and according to the degree
of descent is the inconvenience and suffering. The
first drawing exhibits the natural position of the <span class="nobreak">uterus:—</span></p>

<p>If <i>prolapsus</i> takes place during pregnancy, the womb
impresses upon the bladder and rectum, and occasions irritability
of both those structures; but as pregnancy advances,
and as the womb ascends into the abdomen, these inconveniences
cease, and the womb oftentimes regains its tone
and position after child-birth. The womb sometimes protrudes
externally, and is a source of great distress. See

<p>The treatment in these cases is chiefly mechanical, beside
supporting the general health. The first symptoms,
however, demand efficient attention, and the medical
attendant should be made acquainted with every particular.</p>

<p>It is a question whether the weakened condition of the
supports of the womb, and the consequent relaxed state of
the vagina, are not owing to the manner in which women
clothe themselves. The pelvic part of the female is kept
always in a state of unnatural warmth, from the load of
petticoats and other unnameable female attire. Contrast
but the difference between the simple unlined trowsers of
the male and five or six-fold clothing of the other sex: either
the one must yield too much warmth, or the other
must strike too cold. The sedentary habits of women have
of course much influence.</p>

<p>When retention of urine follows the falling down or
partial descent of the womb, the female should lie on her
back, press the uterus into the pelvis, and urinate in that
position.</p>

<p>The womb, beside becoming displaced, is subject to an
<i>eversion</i>, or a turning inside out. Happily, such cases are
unfrequent, but any disturbance of so important an organ
demands the promptest attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> introduction of the stethoscope and the speculum
constitute two important epochs in medical science—the
former ascertaining, by the conveyance of sound, disease
in the most hidden and inaccessible parts of the human
frame, and the latter bringing to view structures which,
without such aid, are necessarily veiled from our sight.
The speculum consists of an instrument formed of silver or
steel, that without pain or inconvenience is passed into the
vagina, when, by a simple contrivance, it is made to expand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
and dilate the vaginal passage, and thereby expose
to view the entire canal, together with the uterine aperture.
The usefulness of such a method, whereby disease can at
once be detected, admits of no dispute. It is physically
painless; and if opposed to female diffidence and modesty,
its importance and serviceableness should be balanced
against the mental distress such a procedure may occasion.
On the one hand, without its assistance, the treatment of
the disease is at best but conjectural; on the other, by its
aid, it is safe and sure—much suspense and suffering is at
once put an end to. Experience has proved that many
local disturbances, that were believed to have been merely
vaginal irritation, have been discovered to depend upon
absolute disorganization of the neck and mouth of the
womb. Deep-seated ulceration has been detected, and
cancerous enlargements; the disease thereby having been
exposed, has had the necessary and successful treatment.
In Paris, it is considered so valuable that a chair, termed
a “speculum chair,” has been invented solely for its use.
See engraving on previous page.</p>

<p>The speculum is now in the hands of every respectable
medical man, and the class of disorders that hold it in
requisition are being better understood, and consequently
more successfully combated. In no cases is it more useful
than in secretive irregularities, such as in leucorrhœa,
gonorrhœa, or syphilitic ulceration. Without further
comment, these diseases will be considered.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">GONORRHŒA IN THE FEMALE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> disease is rarely so violent as in man, it being
mostly confined to the uterine conduit; in fact, except by
the discharge, women are almost unconscious of its existence,
mistaking it, when occurring in married life, for
leucorrhœa. Occasionally, however, the inflammation is
highly acute, and a variety of distressing symptoms ensue.
There is considerable excoriation around, and a swelling
of the organs, much <i>ardor urinæ</i>, and the same constitutional
disturbance as in the other sex.</p>

<p>The medical treatment of both sexes is constitutionally
alike; but the female has to depend more upon local treatment
than the male. Hence the importance of injections.
Now here is another source of difficulty: women are as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
averse to the use of the syringe as they are to the speculum;
and the consequence is, vaginal diseases are generally
protracted to double as long as they need be. However,
as these hints are likely to be seen only by those who
doubtlessly have, and who indisputably ought, to exercise
it, namely, influence over the sex in persuading them to
submit to what common sense bespeaks as most prudent
and expedient, appropriate formulæ for the suggestions
just recommended will be found a few pages hence. Frequent
ablution, rest, temperate diet—the more farinaceous
and mucilaginous the better, avoiding entirely wines, fermented
and spirituous liquors, together with mild (Form <a id="FManchor_63"></a><a href="#Form_63" class="fmanchor">63</a>) aperients
and salines, constitute the chief means of cure. Injections
are indispensable.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the difficulty of getting female
patients to be their own confessors. If they appoint others,
every possible information should be furnished, and
fastidiousness by no means should supplant the avowal of
real facts. Although gonorrhœa in women is generally
less severe than in the male, it is vexingly oftentimes more
lasting; which is easily accounted for, owing to the extent
of surface diseased: whereas in man it is limited to the
narrow urethra, and seldom exceeds an inch or two upward,
constituting not one tithe part of the space morbidly
affected in the former. See, however, the formulæ.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">SYPHILIS IN FEMALES.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> principal features of syphilis in women consist of
ulcers, excoriations, warts, and buboes. Women, of course,
are alike liable to all the forms of secondary symptoms.
Chancres usually appear <i>within</i> and <i>on</i> the <i>labiæ</i>. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>drawing here given, the labiæ are drawn
aside to expose the ulceration; and they
are also found within the vagina and surrounding
the mouth or protuberance of the
womb. It is in these cases that the speculum
is had recourse to; and in the Parisian
hospitals every case is subject to
such a mode of investigation.</p>

<p>The following three illustrations show what a degree
of severity ulceration and other changes
put on. The first exhibits superficial excoriation
extending rapidly, and occasionally a swollen appearance
of the <i>os uteri</i>; the second shows extensive chancrous
ulceration; and the last of a
tuberculous character, like little
hardened tumors. But for the
speculum, these conditions might
have gone on to worse, and led to
irremediable mischief: their treatment,
independently of local means,
such as injections, &amp;c., would have
been prolonged to an almost indefinite
time. The use of styptics is demanded
in female as well as male syphilitic developments,
and accordingly the employment of nitrate of silver, copper,
&amp;c., is advised, as already explained.</p>

<p>The following drawing shows the extent of mischief and
annoyance to the external organs of female generation
consequent upon neglect. The external labiæ are studded
with chancres. The thighs, buttocks, and rectum,
are dotted and overspread with excoriations. The person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
from whom this sketch is taken was an unfortunate woman
of the town. As it is not my intention to particularize
cases, although from my peculiar province I could fill up
as many pages as this book contains, with details of such
histories, I have only to add, by way of summary, that the
topical and constitutional treatment being alike in both
sexes, the only modifications required will be the regulating
of the doses of the medicines, which must be done
with reference to the idiosyncrasy, age, and temperament,
of the patient. The frail system of woman is less able to
withstand the dire effects of the disease, or the potent
means for its extirpation, than her stronger brotherhood,
and therefore the abler and more experienced the counsel,
the fairer the chance of her recovery; a hint that the
writer feels assured will not be received by those to whom
his pages are addressed, as a vain appeal to repose confidence
in other advice than their own.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">LEUCORRHŒA, FLUOR ALBUS, OR THE WHITES</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the most prevalent of all derangements of the
female economy, connected with the uterine system; and
from its debilitating effects, induces a train of maladies
that tend to embitter personal comfort more than any other
human ill. Leucorrhœa consists of a discharge of acrid,
or bland, but variously-colored mucus from the vagina, differing
in intensity according to the cause and duration. It
would be idle to offer the many arguments set up to prove
whence it proceeds, or to examine the discussions as to
whether it is the produce of the uterine vessels, or the
vaginal secretives. That both aid in its formation is
doubtless the case (as the employment of the speculum has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
satisfactorily proved); and equally certain that, according
to the amount of irritability existing therein, so depends
the quantity and character of the discharge. It exists in
the married and single—in the moral and unchaste; and
therefore the cause should be cautiously divined, it being
evident that other than sexual indulgences establish this
annoying and distressing affliction. It may be fairly conceded
to be a vitiated secretion, depending upon a weakened
state of the local vessels, and, moreover, in particular
habits, to be a salutary evacuation. On the other hand,
it must not be denied that it is oftentimes, where it occurs
to persons living <i>sub judice mariti</i>, the result of sexual
intemperance, or disease springing from an indiscriminate
indulgence in the same.</p>

<p>However, as my purpose is more with the symptoms and
treatment, the following may be received as a summary of
what occurs, and what should be done for the removal
<span class="nobreak">thereof:—</span></p>

<p>In addition to the discharge, which at one time is scanty,
at another profuse, there are usually severe pains in
the loins and lower part of the abdomen: there is a sense
of bearing down, as though the womb were descending
and even protruding. The general health of the patient
is disturbed, loss of appetite, excessive languor, a pale and
emaciated look, sleepless nights, dark areola around the
eyes, various hysterical and other nervous affections, and
numerous disturbances indicating a weakened and impaired
state of mind and body. Among other causes beside those
alluded to, may be enumerated irregular living, late hours,
mental and bodily fatigue, deficient exercise, impure air,
and neglect of personal ablution. Among the consequences
of a long-continued leucorrhœa, an almost certainty of
sterility should not be omitted.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—In leucorrhœa, where or where not consecutive
to gonorrhœa, depending on loss of tone of the secretive
vessels of the internal organs of generation, the chief
indication is to impart vigor and restore strength, which it
is evident depends much upon an avoidance of those causes
that first started the disease.</p>

<p>Although leucorrhœa bears a strong resemblance to
gonorrhœa, there are points by which to distinguish the
one from the other. In gonorrhœa, the discharge is unceasing,
but small in quantity, and is usually accompanied
by inflammatory symptoms; whereas in leucorrhœa, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
discharge is irregular and copious, often coming away in
large lumps.</p>

<p>The treatment of fluor albus is indicated by the degree
of severity present. Where the prominent feature is the
discharge, the indication is to increase the action of the
absorbents by restoring the tone of the diseased surface,
and at the same time to strengthen the system. Where
the disease is complicated with weakness and relaxation,
astringents should be given by the mouth, and also administered
in the form of injections. The alkaline solution
of copaiba is a very valuable medicament, and may be taken
twice or thrice daily. It may also be employed as an
injection, by adding one or two ounces to a pint of water,
and a teacupful thrown up several times in the day. There
are many domestic remedies, which, from their harmless
properties, can at least do no injury, if they are not productive
of good; as, for instance, a strong decoction of
green tea, an infusion of oak bark, or alum-water; or diluted
port wine—all to be used as injections, which, if it
shall so please the patient, may be tried prior to the <span class="nobreak">annexed:—</span></p>

<p>The remaining diseases peculiar to the female pelvic
viscera and their outlet, are hæmorrhoids, irritability and
inflammation of the bladder, disordered uterine functions,
urethritis, or inflammation of the urinary passage, and,
lastly, internal and external irritation or excoriation. But
as these fall within the province of every family practitioner,
to the consultation of whom no morbid delicacy
should prevent a patient, having such in their confidence,
from resorting, I shall conclude this section by appending
sundry prescriptions, in order that, should prudence not
direct the sick one or her friends to call in the advised assistance,
help may not be entirely withheld, and in order
that, if the aid offered be not the means of supplying the
loss of a more proficient and skilful director, it may at least
be found mitigatory of these interruptions of health and

<h2 class="no-page-break">EFFECTS OF INCONTINENCE, CELIBACY, AND MARRIAGE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> past pages relate chiefly to the diseases of the generative
system consequent upon contagion, upon accident,
and the ordinary wear and tear of human life: the following,
to the ills that ensue from the over-indulgence in, and
abstinence from, the proper purposes of the reproductive
organs, and the benefits derivable from a fulfilment of the
intentions of their natural functions.</p>

<p>There may be much good policy and correct feeling in
objecting to the too public inquiry into these matters. The
private closet and the public eye are two very different tribunals,
and what may be approved of in the one is very
likely to be condemned in the other. The line of deciding
what shall be communicated and what should be suppressed
may be drawn too closely; and that knowledge
which is acquired by stealth is seldom so practical as that
obtained by competition. If, therefore, the topics herein
embraced were to be expunged, and their discussion prohibited,
the afflicted would have no other resource than to
apply to the adventuring and ill-educated empiric, instead
of confiding his troubles to the legitimate professional man.
A study, to become useful, should be general; and it is to
be hoped that the prudish reserve which excludes this kind
of investigation from our medical schools will be laid aside,
and truth be obtained by allowable investigation.</p>

<p>The most moral and chaste, at the age of puberty, are
assailed with feelings and desires, that, though new and
unanticipated, yet need little interpretation when present,
and so urgent and imperious, that if not legitimately satisfied,
nature and instinct are not slow in pointing out a
means of gratification.</p>

<p>In the male, imagination commanding a wider range than
in the female, and fed by associations with, and the usages
of, the world, elicits consequences explanatory of life’s
purposes; and the youth having once experienced, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
unsolicited, and possibly during sleep, the agony of seminal
secretion, can rarely withstand the afterward tempting
pleasure of seeking a self-repetition of such solitary indulgence,
which the forbidden union of the sexes, at this early
period, may urge him to.</p>

<p>Setting aside the selfishness and unmanliness of the vice,
it is important that the wearer of the cap and bells should
know the consequences of abusing a given function by such
a means of gratification. There is no mental passion, or
physical exertion, that produces such temporary nervous
prostration as the completion of the act of sexual intercourse;
and it therefore can be easily conceived how debilitating
must be the immoderate indulgence of the practice.
Health consists in a due performance of all the functions
of the organs of the body, and an undue exercise of
them is sure to lead to a disturbance of the economy.</p>

<p>In ordinary sexual commerce, particular phenomena ensue,
the circulation is powerfully roused, the heart thumps
violently, the blood is driven to the brain, and great mental
exaltation is induced, and instances have been known of
death suddenly crushing the transport. The too frequent
repetition of such excitement can not fail to wear out, and
disease the overwrought organs, the heart and brain particularly,
upon the healthy condition of which the health
of the entire frame rests; and hence the diseases of the
libertine are usually consumption, physical weakness, and
mental imbecility, all the result of disordered circulation
and impaired nervous power. If, therefore, such consequences
follow a waste of the allotted privileges of man,
how much more severe must they be that arise from nervous
exhaustion, that which transpires from an absolute
stretch of an already overwrought imagination, from, in
fact, ideal pleasures, instead of those springing from the
instinctive stimulus imparted by the presence of, and cohabitation
with, woman. I have elsewhere treated upon
the sad and withering effects of self-indulgence in a hygæan
point of view. My object here is to portray the consequences
of the like, and the more lawful, intemperance of sexual
cohabitation in a domestic light, in how far it is destructive
to the health and happiness of others, than the
party addressed—the partner of our worldly anxieties, and
the offspring that issue from our union. How striking is
the change of <i>appearance</i> only, much less the positive bodily
condition of married persons of both sexes, within one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
or two years of their union, especially if the match be a
youthful one. Let any one, even with a limited acquaintance,
recollect such of his former female associates, whom
he knew when single, and mayhap may have indulged with
in little modest pleasantries; let him recall the gay-lit
countenance, the ruddy and prominent cheek, the sparkling
and lively eye, the plump and well filled neck—in fact, let
him but compare her then and now, and how disheartening
the change; the same being may be recognised, but it is
the same being only in mind, and not in person. There are
exceptions, as I shall presently show, but this is the too
frequent portraiture of those who embark in precocious
hymeneal contracts, and restrain not the marital privileges.
The countenance assumes, when thoughtful, the careworn
aspect; the blanched cheek shows here and there a furrowed
imprint; the lustre of the eye is dimmed; and, to
drop from the figurative to the literal, the collar-bones,
hitherto “overlaid with nature’s plastic moulding,” seem
appointed only for union’s sake, lest the fabric of neck and
shoulders should drop in pieces. Mark also the decayed
health and spirits; hear the bitter grief of headaches, sideaches,
nerveaches, and behold, perhaps, the puny offspring
“mewling and puling in the nurse’s arms.”</p>

<p>The bridegroom wears a sorrowful and thoughtful look.
He may possess all the comforts which few inherit, but like
Pharaoh’s lean kine, as chaff thrown before the wind, their
purpose is opposed.</p>

<p>This may be held as a ridiculous picture, but I defy denial
of its unhappily too frequent illustration in real life.
A word or two on the opposite extreme, <i>continence</i>. The
reader will observe, in another page, the remark that every
part, be it flesh, bone, or nerve, has its use. The reproductive
organs have theirs; but it is not only for the propagation
of the species—they afford an outlet for accumulated
secretion—they aid in resolving the animal passions—they
are the secret incentive to sexual love, and the bond
of union between the sexes. They give an appetite that,
like hunger, must be appeased, or nature revolts; and the
harmony of society falls before the ungovernable fury of
maniacal craving. Health, the source of all happiness,
without the possession of which the world with its beauties
would be, for all we cared, tenantless, materially rests upon
a proper and moderate use of the copulative process. Entire
continence, a rarity among mankind, establishes in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
both sexes the most miserable perversions of mind and
body. In man, we have instances recorded of mania, melancholy,
apoplexy, and foul skin-disorders. Blindness,
deafness, and a host of evils, some greater, and few less
than these just penned. It is true, continence is, as
remarked, but seldom observed, especially in males, who,
being denied sexual commerce, are estranged by the distressful
habit of onanism; and thereby, in some measure,
the enumerated maladies are avoided; but as masturbation,
like other vices, grows with unbounded speed, a train of
ills, far more distressful, await the sufferer, who, in addition,
becomes, in the meridian of life, deprived of the very
power he in youth was so improvident of. Continence in
females, which all admit to be the brightest ornament a
woman possesses, is attended with a poor requital; and its
prevalence (to the honor of our countrywomen be it spoken)
is truly attested by the miseries of hysteria, and other nervous
derangements, that pervade the junior and elderly
maiden branches of every family, and constitute so formidable
an enemy to domestic felicity. A wide field is open
for comment upon this subject, which is better adapted for
the moralist than the physician. This manual, professing
to be but a vehicle for topics of a professional nature only,
the writer apologises for the digression, and can but express
his regret, that public opinion is unfavorable to the
discussion of such matters, which embrace considerations
highly important to a nation, both in a moral and hygæan
view. Continent persons but seldom attain old age;
whereas, the married females, for instance, although exposed
to the dangers of pregnancy and delivery, live generally
longer than those who are unmarried or chaste; and
provident married men escape the ills and snares that beset
single <i>blessedness</i>, as it is called. Libertinism, on the
other hand, in whatever way practised, is hurtful and destructive
to long life.</p>

<p>Continence may be a virtue, but is not imposed where
marriage is allowable; and then, if deviated from with
moderation only, the greatest amount of health and happiness
may be elicited, and the proper end of it obtained.
Matrimony, where succeeded by the birth of children, powerfully
conduces to the health and happiness of women.</p>

<p>Many female disorders are relieved by marriage. Amenorrhœa
and chlorosis, disordered conditions of the uterine
functions, hysteria, scrofula, skin-affections, numerous nervous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
disorders, and many local complaints, yield as soon as
pregnancy commences.</p>

<p>Results should, however, be well weighed, before irrevocable
steps are taken. There are many diseases and
structural impediments opposed to the matrimonial contract.
Malformation and mental imbecility should be held
as strong interdicts to the conjugal union. People ought
not to marry before manhood is well developed (the male
at least 21 to 23 years of age, the female 18 to 21). Precocious
or late marriages are injurious to reproduction.
The unnatural union of old and young of either sex with
the other, entails its own miseries. A curious estimate of
salacious appetites and power has been drawn up as pervading
the different temperaments. The temperaments, as
elsewhere noticed, are four—the Sanguine, Nervous, Bilious,
and Phlegmatic. Persons of the sanguine temperament
are generally of good health, and vigorous in amorous
pleasures. The nervous are extremely susceptible in
their sensations, and generally much given to female society.
Combined with the sanguine, they are capable of
great amorous excesses. The bilious temperament imparts
a jealous bearing in all affairs of sexual solicitude, that detracts
from the fondness and affection which so entwine a
woman to a lover or a husband. The melancholic or
phlegmatic person is frigid and apathetic in his amours; and
love becomes with him a secondary consideration to advancement
in life. These temperaments are frequently intermixed,
and are much modified by age and health; and
the salacious powers correspond.</p>

<p>Speculations have arisen among physiologists, as to the
effect of climate and season, as well as age and temperament,
on the reproductive powers. Temperate and warm
climates are more prolific in exciting the copulative desire,
than the frigid and uncongenial situations of the northern
hemisphere. The seasons bear a somewhat near analogy—spring
is supposed to be more potent than summer, autumn,
or winter, in arousing the amative propensities,
which, like the productions of the earth, come, as it were,
at that time into a new existence. This observation is
borne out by the statistical fact of there being a greater
number of births about Christmas and the new year, than
any other period.</p>

<p>Man, however, is allowed to be omnivorous in <i>all</i> his
appetites; and the uniformity of his sexual greediness is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
preserved by diet corresponding to the season, which renders
the whole twelvemonth a perpetual spring. Man, as
well as other animals, is, when in a state of health, capable
of procreating upon almost any food. But when there
is debility of the digestive or generative organs, the injury
can be repaired by the use of proper stimulating diet, thereby
occasioning due and sufficient secretions.</p>

<p>Air, exercise, health, and prosperity, are not without
considerable influences. If seasons are not positively influential,
certain it is, that particular lunar and solar periods
are, taken in conjunction with the state of the body.</p>

<p>“Morning,” says a French writer, “is the spring of the
journey, when all the functions of the body are renovated.”
Others declare, that when night veils the light of the day,
the quietude and secresy thereby afforded, offer moments
most congenial to the gratification of mutual love. Sexual
transports should be avoided after a repast, instances having
been known of apoplexy being induced by the excitement
of connexion being superadded to the stimulative influence
of wine and food.</p>

<p>Henry II. consulted one Fernal for the infertility of his
queen, Catherine de Medicis. The advice submitted, comprised
the following notifications: Abundant and peculiar
nourishment; occasional change of residence; the allowing
several days to elapse between each conjugal act; and
lastly, that the most favorable moment for impregnation
was immediately on the cessation of menstruation. It was
not until the adoption of these hints, that her majesty conceived.</p>

<p>Professor Dewees, of Philadelphia, enjoins that, for the
enjoyment of marriage and the production of children, matrimony
should not be engaged in, until the body is healthily
and completely developed; until then the most scrupulous
continency should be preserved. From the 23d to the 25th
year is the suggested period for the male; from the 19th to
the 21st, the female. These observations apply to Europeans
chiefly; for in India, women become mothers at ten,
owing to their early development. Precocious marriages
bring premature decay on the father and mother, and entail
on their offspring, diminutive stature, debility of body,
and imbecility of mind, thus generating consumption, scrofula,
insanity, &amp;c. Well-regulated marriages contribute to
social and lasting happiness, and the prosperity of the nation
at large; but ill-assorted ones, those where the peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
of either is infringed by opposing tempers, or by the after-discovery
of hitherto concealed physical incapacities, present
a scene of wretchedness and disappointment to which
death itself were preferable. These remarks might be considerably
amplified; but enough has been said, to induce
those who approach to manhood, to be provident of that
which, once lost, is, under all circumstances, difficult to regain;
and those on the eve of embarking in the most binding
and solemn obligation of all human contracts, marriage,
to ponder well, ere they compromise the happiness
of others as well as themselves, by engaging in a compact,
they may know themselves incapable of fulfilling or of efficiently
performing; one from which they can not with
honor retreat, and one that, once sealed, demands a rigid
compliance with its recognised duties.</p>

<p>The gist of the present article may then thus be summed
up: That self-indulgence and excessive sexual cohabitation
are hurtful in the highest degree; that they induce early
impuissance, and bring down a load of menial and corporeal
ailments. That premature marriages are destructive
to health and long life, and that weak and sickly children
are the general result where impregnation of the female
follows. That entire continence was never ordained, and
is alike productive of disease. That moderate copulation
propagates the human kind, preserves health, and promotes
longevity, and the sexual capability is thereby retained to
the latest verge of senility.</p>

<p>That it is unnatural and unjust for impuissant persons
to intermarry with those having healthy expectations, and
the power of enjoyment; and that it behooves all who have
a doubt as to their own capacity, to have that doubt removed;
but, if rendered evident, to abstain from shipwrecking
their own happiness, or from occasioning disappointment
to others.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">THE HEREDITARY TRANSMISSION OF DISEASE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> topics of Incontinence, Celibacy, and Marriage,
having been severally considered relatively to their effects
on society, viewed alike also as to their influence on the
health and happiness of the sexes in general, another
equally engrossing one naturally presents itself for inquiry
to every thinking and sensible person who may contemplate,
or be about embarking in what the world deems “a
serious speculation,” matrimony, namely, the probability
of issue, and how far the health of the progeny may be influenced
by that of the parents. That conception requires
the necessary aptitudes in both man and wife is indisputable;
and that although such capacities are rarely absent,
still all unions are not prolific; hence the inference, that
some cause must exist to account for such infertility.</p>

<p>It may be local or moral, as elsewhere in this volume
explained, which not being the main purport of this paper,
needs no other allusion beyond the mere reference. The
prevailing resemblance between parents and children in
features, form, voice, and even constitutional peculiarities,
is sufficiently well known to satisfy any one of the similar
possibility of the transmission of disease, or sound health.
“It is of great consequence to be well-born; and it were
happy for human kind, if only such persons as are sound
of body and mind should be allowed to marry.”</p>

<p>We find in Boethius’s work, “De veterum Scotorum
Moribus,” that anciently, in Scotland, if any were visited
with the falling sickness, madness, gout, leprosy, or any
such dangerous disease, which was likely to be propagated
from the father to the son, he was instantly gelded; a woman
kept from all company of men; and, if by chance,
having some such disease, she were to be found with child,
she with her offspring was buried alive. The Spartans
destroyed all weakly and deformed children.</p>

<p>Great as the anxiety may be to perpetuate our identities,
to create new objects on whom we may concentrate all our
affections and love, and who, when born to us, so instinctively
bind us the more to this already attractive world,
where is the man who does not feel humbled and mortified
at beholding in his anxiously looked-for offspring, the unfolding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
of infirmity and disease? We are content to encounter
the ordinary chances of mortality, let but our
children bear the impress of health, and possess the shape
of perfect man; but sad and desolating are the reflections
that spring from observing in our issue the developments
of the evils we have nurtured in ourselves. How many
existing beings are there, inhaling the breath of life, in
whom every respiration feeds the flame of disease, ignited
by those from whose loins they sprung, and is hastening
them to a premature tomb. How many are there, secluded
from the enjoyment of that, which being deprived of by
some scrofulous, pestilential, or other hideous deformity,
renders them like isolated wanderers on the earth, and
for ever forbids their participation in the main charm of
existence—social intercourse. How many living specimens
of human prototypes, in whom reason is obliterated, or
never dawned, drag on an existence inferior in enjoyment
to the forest-hunted beast, or the animal whose life is
yielded for the nutriment of man. And are not the diseases
that involve so calamitous a result, consumption, scrofula,
gout, idiocy, or insanity, traceable in particular families,
to the remotest periods of their ancestral records? And
should not then a knowledge of cause and effect, like that
just detailed, induce individuals about to fulfil one of the
purposes to which they were certainly destined, for the
perpetuation of their own race, if only from the pride of
human nature, well to consider the result of such a consummation?
The health of either party is generally omitted
among the categories bandied about preliminary to the
completion of the other, though decidedly not more important,
arrangements of the nuptial contract; or if it should
not be, many infirmities, that are well known to descend
hereditarily, are (granted in some cases not premeditatedly,
but from ignorance of such a result) yet carefully concealed.
Cutaneous blemishes, incipient tubercles, or a
scrofulous predisposition, which may be likened to the
germes of a fruitful plant sown in a torpid soil, lie in ambush,
and await some genial transplantation to display
their productiveness, which matrimony, by the analogous
change which it effects in different constitutions, speedily
encourages. In this manner, other morbid phenomena are
aroused from their lurking place, whether it be in the
brain, the lungs, or the blood, and transferred to those who
succeed us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>I need not, therefore, waste a line prefatory to, or apologetic
of, the following illustrative definition of health, by
which any one with tolerable acumen may estimate the
probable “worth of a life,” or, at all events, be spared
the plea of ignorance, or misplaced confidence, when taking
a step of such importance as wedlock. There are
numerous means of calculating upon the durability of human
life, by an examination of the countenance, the gait,
the attitude, the form, the skin, the temperament, the
breathing, the speech, the sleep, and in fact, to a practised
professional eye, there is not much difficulty in observing
some diagnostic mark, if sickness be secreted in the constitution.
The countenance in health varies with the age.
Health is indicated by a plump, not puffy or bloated state
of the face, a fresh complexion, and an absence of that depression
around and particularly below the eye, so observable
in persons of sick health. The nose should not be
“pinched,” as it were, at its junction with the face, nor
should there be deep indentations, called furrows, or
wrinkles, at the angles of the mouth or eyes, which rarely
are manifested in healthy individuals, except they be aged
through care or time. Many people part very reluctantly
with each succeeding year, and few conform to the outward
symbols of age. The era was when age was honorable;
now few aspire to it, and such is the deception that would
be practised, that the coffin-plate is the only tell-tale.</p>

<p>If the teeth have dropped out or decayed, the lower jaw
will be observed to be more elevated, the lips drawn inward
over the gums, and the chin and nose approximating
each other; the cheek bones will also be very prominent,
and the skin thereon shiny and tightly drawn: these are
pretty fair characteristics of disease, or old age. The temperaments
modify the complexion. In the sanguine, it is
florid and soft; in the bilious, dark and rigid; in the
phlegmatic, lax and pallid; and the nervous is modified by
its general union with the two former. In health, the
countenance is expressive of contentment and gayety,
which indicate a happy state of mind, and healthy condition
of body. In ill-health, it is pale and expressive of languor
and sadness, signifying discontent and nervous debility.
Where asthma exists, or other nervous affections of the
chest prevail, there is pallidness or lividity, a worn-down
and distressing look, and in consumption, in addition to
the above, there are alternately, on the slightest exertion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
gentle flushings. A bluish tint of the skin denotes some
organic affection of the heart. In dropsy, the countenance
is bloated, or of a waxy puffiness; and in acute indigestion,
there is a lividity of the lips, nose, and cheeks. A slow
and cautious step, a bending of the body, a laxity and flabby
feel of the muscles of the arms, chest, and lower extremities,
a tumid abdomen, or a swelling of the feet and ankles,
are no indications of health. Tremulous hands mark age,
nervousness, or intemperance. Hurried breathing, palpitation
of the heart, frequent attacks of perspiration, sleeplessness,
are all symptomatic of weakness, hysteria, or
disease. Persons subject to bleedings, are usually of a
waxy paleness, and soft fibre. Allowances must be made
for females during the menstrual period, whose complexion,
at that period, being less clear and fair, is marked by a
dark areola around and below the eyes, the breath is
slightly tainted, and a languor is evidenced in all their actions.
A voracious or scanty appetite, a dry and shrinking
skin, a furred and loaded tongue with indented sides,
signify the digestive organs to be deranged. In long-standing
dyspepsia, the nose, feet, and hands, are generally
cold. Emaciation is an infallible diagnostic of disturbed
health, and a bloated state equally characteristic. Fits,
gout, rheumatic disorders, asthma, occasional brain affections,
diseases of the bladder, &amp;c., can not be considered
as warranties of health.</p>

<p>Lastly, with respect to intemperance, the bloated appearance,
the tremulous state of the muscular powers, the
fetid breath, and the sunken eye, sufficiently identify the
cause, to arrest all doubts on the subject. Where intemperance
exists in married life, it is the bane of all comfort
and enjoyment; and heaven help the unhappy partner of
such a companion. There is but one consolation, that
every indulgence of this insane practice tends to sap and
break up the powers of the constitution, and hastens the
close of such a union. The drunkard should be reminded,
that “some leaves fall from the tree every time that its
trunk is shaken;” and the dreary nakedness of winter is
brought on, long before that season would have commenced
in the regular course of nature.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">IMPUISSANCE, OR IMPOTENCE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> pursuing the consideration of the following infirmities
of the Reproductive System, a few prefatory observations
are requisite. Perhaps of all the physical powers
possessed by man, few are subject to so much abuse as the
procreative organs—certainly none are more required to
be, in a hygiænic point of view, held in a sounder condition
of health, for upon their tone and perfect structure hinge
the happiness and perpetuation of the human race. In this
age of luxury and sensuality, however, the world seems
untiringly hunting after, and more or less obtaining, sexual
gratification. There can be no doubt, that a greater
amount of this species of sensual enjoyment is indulged in
before manhood arrives, than can be obtained when man
should be in his vigor. The writer is not insensible to the
many alluring publications upon this topic, the end and
aim of which are not, honestly, to afford relief to the diffident
sufferer, but to add to his misery, by draining his
pocket. Of legitimate publications, alas! there are but
few, for it appears that qualified medical men have, from
some prudish or other such notions, kept aloof from entering
the lists. Were it otherwise, many an unfortunate
victim might be spared from the avaricious clutch of the
empiric; but invalids, from such a knowledge of the absence
of fair and honorable references, are obliged to seek
(or despair of) relief from the unworthy class in question.
How far the tendency of the present work may lead to a
reformation, is left for the reader to decide. The novelty
of the present compendium may subject it to invidious suspicion;
the author but invites comparison, feeling convinced
that the contents best bespeak its legitimacy and usefulness.</p>

<p>“Increase and multiply,” is the scriptural text. “Plant
trees and beget offspring,” is the apothegm of the Magi.
The perpetuation of the species being, with the great Designer
of the universe, an object of the first interest, all
living beings are mentally and physically formed with a
view to this great end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>In the human species, procreation is effected by a congress
of the two sexes, and a variety of organs are provided,
upon whose condition the due performance of coition
mainly depends. The male is destined to furnish a peculiar
fecundating secretion, and is accordingly provided with
glands to prepare such fluid, and a conduit to convey the
same to its proper destination; while the female, being the
recipient, possesses an organ capable of effecting a mysterious
yet specific change upon the fluid so deposited: a
failure, therefore, in any of the structures alluded to, is
followed by impotence or sterility.</p>

<p>Impotence implies the incapability of sexual intercourse;
sterility, the inability of procreation; the causes of either
of which may be deemed organic, functional, or moral.
The following section will be devoted, firstly, to its consideration
in its relation to the male.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>SECTION I.</h3>

<p class="center small">IMPOTENCE AND STERILITY OF THE MALE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> the hindrance to cohabitation arises from organic
defect, congenital malformation, or diseases of some
of the organs of generation, the disqualification may generally
be considered absolute or irremediable. It is remarkable,
however, to what extent mutilation or disease
may occur, without total annihilation of the procreative
powers; the smallest remnant of the penis, for instance,
capable of entering the vagina, provided the testes be
sound, being sufficient for impregnation.</p>

<p>A learned lecturer on medical jurisprudence gives it as
his opinion, that the smallest quantity of seminal discharge,
deposited in the lower part of the female generative apparatus,
<i>provided the female be apt to conceive</i>, is sufficient for
impregnation: and it is astonishing how <i>minute</i> a quantity
of this plastic agent is necessary for that purpose in some
species of creatures. Spallanzani took three grains by
weight of the male fluid of the frog, and mixing it with
seventeen ounces of water, found that impregnation of the
eggs was produced by as much of this exceedingly weak
mixture as would adhere to the point of a fine needle.</p>

<p>Although, in human formation, it is not essentially necessary
that the male material should be deposited in the
upper part of the vagina of the female, yet there is little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
doubt that the deeper entrance of this substance conduces
to impregnation.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Malformation of the genital organs has already been
stated as a cause of impotence. Such cases furnish much
uneasiness at first, but are easily relievable. I have met
with many instances, where consummation has been prolonged
from months to years, which a slight knowledge of
the functions of the parturient organs might have relieved
in a few days; and with respect to the latter, it may be
pardonable to mention that, as the husband should be the
first to instruct his companion in what is to be expected,
but little disappointment will be experienced, except with
the vicious and unworthy.</p>

<p>There is room for much ingenuity in these matters;
and as marriages are made for better or worse, there exist
powerful inducements to resort to the contrivances of the
ingenious and humane.</p>

<p>The following case of malformation fell under my own
observation; the adjoining delineation is a true picture of
the circumstance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">

<p>The penis, <i>b</i>, at its
under surface, was adherent, from birth,
to the scrotum <i>c</i>, consequently, when
erection ensued, it presented the form
of a half circle; the urine escaped near
the root of the penis, <i>a</i>. The penis itself
was impervious, but sensible to the
amative passion. The gentleman submitted
to a division of the fold which
united the penis with the scrotum, which
former, on being thus released, assumed its proper position;
sexual congress was thereby attainable, and during
erection the orifice of the urethra was drawn sufficiently
up to allow of the ejection of the semen into the vagina.
Of the ultimate result I have yet to hear.</p>

</div>

<p>It may appear almost incredible, that the sketch here
presented can be a true one of the penis and
testicles of a young man upward of 19 years
of age. No less was it a source of wonderment
to myself than it may afford a doubt to
others. I carefully examined the individual,
and saw him urinate; the stream was certainly
small, but surprisingly large for so minute an organization.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
He was quite unconscious of amative feeling;
the testicles were distinctly perceptible by the finger, but
they certainly were not larger than cherry kernels. The
young man, in other respects, preserved the male attributes;
he had a slight beard, and his voice, though not
powerful, was by no means effeminate. I had several interviews
with him, and then lost sight of him.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere portrayed a relaxed state of the testicle,
called varicocele: the accompanying draught exhibits the
same in an aggravated form. The patient
possessed but little amative power,
and had also a thickened condition of the
prepuce, which produced a perfect <i>phymosis</i>.
The case, however, under treatment
became considerably relieved. The
phymosis required a division of the prepuce,
an operation productive but of little
and momentary pain, or rather twinge,
and healed in a few days. Children are
sometimes not procreated for want of
sufficient erectile and consequently penetrative
power of the male organ. Much
and often needless misery results from
this infirmity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">

  </div>
</div>

<p>The loss of erectile power is occasioned through more
causes than one. Erection ensues independently of the
will or imagination, as instanced on awaking in the morning—the
cause is most probably a distended bladder; the
phenomena may be a sympathetic irritability of the muscles
of the perinœum, especially the erectores; there is a
general pelvic disturbance, the nervous excitement is increased,
and the rush of blood (obedient to that excitement)
is sent to the penis: such, I believe, is the sympathy
between all these structures. The will exercises the same,
and the results of the imagination do not materially differ;
consequently, where the mind fails in producing these effects,
local excitants may be found to supply its office
hence the usefulness of art in combating the eccentricities
of nature. The mere handling of the testicles kindles desire,
and in like manner, stimulatives applied over the
scrotum generate amative heat.</p>

<p>A curve of the penis is sometimes an obstruction to connubial
intercourse; this arises from adhesion or obliteration
of the cells of the <i>Corpora Cavernosa</i> on one side only,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
preventing the uniform flow of blood into those structures,
and consequently the equal distention of the penis. The
curve is of course laterally, and occasions in the act of coition
pain to both parties, or the power of penetration is
insufficient. Occasionally this malformation is only temporary,
and consequently remediable.</p>

<p><i>Franck</i> gives an instance in which so considerable a portion
of the penis had been carried away by a musket-shot,
that when the wound healed, the organ remained curved,
and yet proved adequate to the performance of its functions.</p>

<p>An opinion formerly prevailed, that the existence of the
testes was unnecessary for effective copulation; but that
is no longer a point of dispute: their absence, whether
natural or artificial, invariably rendering the invalid unfruitful.
It is not, however, to be inferred, that a person
is impotent in whom no testicles are discovered in the
scrotum, instances occurring where they do not descend
from the abdomen (their embryotic abode) through the
whole period of life. One testicle, provided it be sound,
is sufficient for procreation. Complete extirpation of the
testes, although destructive of procreative powers, does
not extinguish venereal desire. Where the genital organs
exist, but are malformed, or pathologically altered, their
virility may be nullified.</p>

<p>The most frequent malformation is in the <i>urethra</i>, which sometimes
opens in the perinœum—the part marked <i>a</i> in the annexed cut; at
others, on the dorsum of the penis, and not unfrequently under its
surface: so long, however, as the orifice opens in that portion of the
penis which enters the vagina, so that the <i>emissio seminis</i> may be
therein deposited, impregnation may and will take place; and even in
cases where artificial means have been employed to convey the fluid.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 35em;">

  </div>
</div>

<p>A contracted state of the prepuce, its adherence to the
glans, or that condition of it termed phymosis, form impediments
to the emission of the semen which can only be
removed by an operation; and if that be neglected, the
evil continues through life.</p>

<p>Among the diseases which occasion sterility in the male,
those affecting the penis and those incident to the testicles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
may be enumerated. With regard to the former, there
often exists an excess or deficiency of muscular or nervous
energy, inducing <i>priapism</i> or permanent erection in some
instances, or paralysis or permanent flaccidity in others.
In <i>priapism</i>, the erection is so vigorous, and all the parts
so distended, that the semen can not pass into the urethra;
while in <i>paralysis</i>, from some inaptitude of nervous or
muscular powers of the genital organs, the <i>corpora cavernosa</i>
receive but a limited supply of blood, insufficient to
create erection, or provoke a seminal discharge.</p>

<p>Strictures of the urethra are among the barriers to sexual
intercourse; but happily, only in extreme cases, where
the urethra is all but closed, so as to oppose the passing
of the finest bougie.</p>

<p>The testicle is subject to a variety of diseases, wherein
such a relaxation or obliteration of its structure ensues,
that the seminal fluid is no longer formed: and where
both testicles are alike affected, sexual desire is most usually
wholly extinguished—the smallest portion, however,
of either gland remaining uninjured, may still be capable
of secreting semen sufficient for impregnation.</p>

<p>Impotence may follow accidents to the testicles, such as
produced by a bruise; or even a testicle, which shall have
become inflamed from clap, shall become so chronically
hardened as to be useless. Bruising the testicles was the
mode adopted by the oriental courts for destroying masculine
efficiency in the attendants of the harem.</p>

<p>There are certain conditions of health in which, although
the genital organs may be perfect, yet, owing to
some constitutional frigidity, there is an incapability of
erection. The offspring of too young, or very aged, infirm
persons, or of those worn down by debauchery, are but too
common instances.</p>

<p>The appearance of persons of this temperament is thus
described by a French writer: “The hair is white, fair,
and thin; no beard, and countenance pale; flesh soft and
without hair; voice clear, sharp, and piercing; the eyes
sorrowful and dull; the form round, shoulders narrow;
perspiration acid; testicle small, withered, pendulous, and
soft; the spermatic chords small; the scrotum flaccid;
the gland of the testicle insensible; no capillary growth
on the pubis; a moral apathy; pusillanimity and fear on
the least occasion.”</p>

<p>The most frequent cause of impotence, at that period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
of existence when man should be in the zenith of his procreative
power, is in a general weakness of the generative
organs, induced by too early an indulgence in coition, the
pernicious and demoralizing crime of masturbation, or the
abuse of venereal pleasures. In these cases, erection will
not take place, or but feebly, although the mind be highly
excited by lascivious ideas. The erector muscles are paralysed
from over-use, and the semen, if any is secreted,
from the lax and withered state of the testes, is clear, serous,
without consistence, and consequently deficient of
prolific virtue. Sometimes there is a want of consent between
the immediate and secondary organs of generation;
thus, the penis acts without the testicles, and becomes
erected when there is no semen to be evacuated; while
the testicles secrete too quickly, and an evacuation takes
place without any erection of the penis; the latter disappointment
is of extensive prevalence.</p>

<p>Impotence is sometimes occasioned by particular diseases
during their continuance, such as nervous and malignant
fevers; while, strange to relate, an opposite effect is sometimes
produced by other diseases, such as gout and rheumatism,
hæmorrhoids, &amp;c.; and instances are on record,
that others produce such a change in the constitution, that
an impotent man may find himself cured of his impotency
on their cessation.</p>

<p>Of all the functions of the animal economy, none are so
subservient to nervous influence as those of generation,
which, when the organs are perfect, and respond not to the
natural application of them, the cause may be classed
among those impediments termed moral.</p>

<p>As the parts of generation are not necessary for the existence
or support of the individual, but have a reference
to something else in which the mind has a principal concern;
so a complete action in those parts can not take
place without a perfect harmony of body and mind, that is,
there must be both a power of body and disposition of
mind; for the mind is subject to a thousand caprices which
affect the action of these parts.</p>

<p>As these cases do not arise from real inability, they are
to be carefully distinguished from such as do; and, perhaps,
the only way to distinguish them, is to examine into
the state of mind respecting this act. So trifling often is
the circumstance which shall produce this inability depending
on the mind, that the very desire to please shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
have that effect, as in making the woman the sole object
to be gratified.</p>

<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<p class="center small">IMPOTENCE AND STERILITY OF THE FEMALE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A female</span> may be impotent, and not sterile; and sterile,
but not impotent. Impotence can only exist in the female,
when there is an impervious vagina; but even this condition
does not necessarily infer sterility, many cases being
recorded, where the semen, by some means or another,
through an aperture that would not admit a fine probe, has
found entrance to the vagina and occasioned impregnation.</p>

<p>Impotence may arise from a malformed pelvis, the absence
of a vagina, adhesion of its labia, unruptured hymen,
or one of such strength as to resist intromission. In
the two former instances, sterility is irremediable; but
art, and indeed nature, may overcome the latter impediments.</p>

<p>Were these pages intended only for the surgery, instead of the
public, the annexed wood cuts would be unnecessary, medical men being
conversant with the inconvenience in question; but all the world not
being blessed with similar anatomical information, the sketches are
presented. The upper one represents the relative situation of the
female urethra (1), and the contracted orifice of the hymen (2).
In the cases of hardened obstruction, where the hymen assumes an
almost cartilaginous texture, the attempts at marital consummation
are fruitless, and often give rise to severe local inflammation. The
infirmity, on the other hand, is easily and painlessly removable by
surgical skill. The lower drawing represents a hymen with two apertures
(2), which, if broken down by violence, leaves a troublesome lacerated
wound. The surgeon’s assistance is indispensable.</p>

<p>Where hermaphroditism exists, the sex is
usually more masculine; it is a vulgar error
to suppose that the two sexes exist entire, and that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
are capable of giving and receiving the offices of married
life. The present sketch is merely introduced
to show the more frequent malformation. The penis exists, but has no
urethra: below is an opening resembling
the vagina of the female, which is but of
short length, at the bottom of which (in
fact, the perineum) the urethra opens.
The testicles are entire, and the individual
from whom the draft was taken possessed
somewhat the desire of the male, without
the capability of penetration: the penis,
when excited, from its attachment to the lips of the imaginary
vagina, and also from its
contracted form, presenting
merely a kind of bulbous tumor.
Even where hermaphroditism
more closely partakes
of the female, conception never
takes place; hence all such
parties are sterile.</p>

<p>In the instance of a deceased
married female,
that fell under
my observation, the uterus or womb presented
the following appearances: The usual
cavity was discoverable, but it was filled
with a <i>cheesy</i>-like substance, and also there
were some ulcered-looking caverns filled
with the same material. This female, while
living, endured continued pains in the uterine
region, was insensible to marital physical
enjoyments, sterile, although a wife several
years, and the constant sufferer from a vaginal
discharge. Her death was consequent
upon a severe cold that ended in consumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>Leucorrhœa is often attended with barrenness; at all
events, it is very debilitating, and thus impedes conception.
A notion once prevailed, that women who did not menstruate
could not conceive; it has since been disproved,
except in those instances where menstruation never occurred:
a single monthly discharge indicates an aptitude for
conception. It is observed that barren women have very
small breasts. Women who are very fat are often barren,
for their corpulence either exists as a mark of weakness
of the system, or it depends upon a want of activity in the
ovaria: thus spayed or castrated animals generally become
fat. The same remarks apply to the male kind, who are
outrageously corpulent. There are many other peculiarities
in matrimonial life, fertile subjects for speculation;
such as, for instance, the lapse of time that often occurs
after marriage before conception takes place, and the
space between each act of gestation; the solution of which
may be, that these occurrences are modified by certain
aptitudes, dispositions, state of health, &amp;c.; the same may
explain why persons have lived together for years in unfruitful
matrimony, and who yet, after being divorced, and
marrying others, have both had children.</p>

<p>It is not always that the most healthy women are more
favorable to conception than the spare and feeble. High
feeding and starvation are alike occasionally inimical to
breeding. The regularity of the “courses” appears principally
essential to secure impregnation; and the intercourse
is generally held likely to be the more fruitful that
takes place early after that customary relief.</p>

<p>Women in health are capable of bearing children, on an
average, for a period of thirty years, from the age of fifteen
to forty-five; but their incapacity to procreate does not
deny them the sexual gratification, it being well accredited,
that women upward of seventy years of age have
been known, who have lost but little of the amative inclination
and enjoyment which they possessed in their early
days. Men certainly possess their procreative power to a
longer period, it being common for men to become fathers
at eighty, ninety, and one hundred—old Parr becoming a
parent at the age of one hundred and thirty. Women
rarely fall pregnant beyond fifty.</p>

<p>Some females endure intense pain during coition, so as
to occasion fainting or great exhaustion. Such suffering
is usually traceable to internal ailments—such as <i>piles</i>, <i>fistulous</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
<i>openings</i> between the <i>rectum</i> and <i>vagina</i>, <i>ulcerated
wombs</i>, <i>vaginal tumors or abscesses</i>. Cases continually
present themselves, where, on the removal of the cause,
the effect is cured.</p>

<p>The number of children that women have individually
given birth to is very variable. It is attested, among a
collection of facts of this nature, that one female gave
birth to eighteen children at six births; another, forty-four
children in all, thirty in the first marriage and fourteen in
the second; and in a still more extraordinary case, fifty-three
children in all, in one marriage, eighteen times single
births, five times twins, four times triplets, once six,
and once seven.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Men have been known to beget seventy
or eighty children in two or more marriages. With regard
to the average proportion of male and female births, it appears
that the males predominate about four or five only
in one hundred. The average number of children in each
marriage is, in England, from five to seven.</p>

<p>To a continual irritability of temper among females
may be ascribed infertility. Independently of ever fostering
domestic disquietude, it produces thinness and feeble
health; and, where pregnancy does ensue, it most frequently
provokes miscarriages, or leads to the birth of ill-conditioned
and puny offspring.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most indispensable and endearing
qualifications of the feminine character is an amiable
temper. Cold and callous must be the man who does not
prize the meek and gentle spirit of a confiding woman.
Her lips may not be sculptured in the line of perfect
beauty, her eye may not roll in dazzling splendor, but if
the native smile be ever ready to welcome, and the glance
fraught with clinging devotion, or shrinking sensibility,
she must be prized far above gold or rubies. A few moments
of enduring silence would often prevent years of
discord and unhappiness; but the keen retort and waspish
argument too often break the chain of affection, link by
link, and leave the heart with no tie to hold it but a cold
and frigid duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>
<h3>SECTION III.</h3>

<p class="center small">TREATMENT OF IMPOTENCE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> venturing upon this part of the subject, it will be as
well, first, to distinguish those cases that are curable from
those that admit of no relief. Among the latter may be
enumerated all those arising from an original or accidental
defect in the organs of generation. Where, also,
old age is the cause, little is to be done: medicines
are of no avail, and temporary stimuli not unfrequently
worse.</p>

<p>That certain medicaments, aliments, and so forth, do
possess an <i>aphrodisiac</i> power, is not to be denied; but
when adopted by those weak beings, whose bodies are either
worn out by age or excess, and who pin their faith to
such restoratives, the little remaining sensibility in their
frames, the source of life and energy, can not sustain the
shock of reaction; and the result is, total annihilation or
death.</p>

<p>From what has already been stated, it will be perceived,
that the mind exercises no inconsiderable influence over
the functions of the organs of generation: and as the state
of the mind depends upon the particular circumstances
under which it may be placed, any attempt to establish a
code of instructions, applicable to every instance in which
a sportive fancy, or disturbed imagination, constituted the
prevailing cause, would be abortive, and might be considered
as pandering to a vicious and depraved appetite,
whereas the object of this treatise is only to encourage the
diffident, to assist the afflicted, and render a service to
those legitimately deserving it.</p>

<p>As excess in sexual indulgence impairs the generative
power, no less injurious may entire abstinence be considered.
The due exercise of an organ tends to its perfection,
as the neglect or misuse of it, to its impairment.
Besides, there is not any wonderful virtue in abstaining
from the proper use of the sexes. Why, in the name of
morality, were such powerful impulses and desires bestowed
upon us? Why were such wonderful organizations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
given to us, if they were not originally designed to be used
by every one who is possessed of them? Society, in its
present form, is not perhaps constructed with a philosophical
regard to our own natural instincts, and our own original
rights.</p>

<p>Among the causes that induce <i>impuissance</i>, or that distressing
condition known under the cognomen of <i>nervous
debility</i>, there is not one more reprehensive than the unworthy
and pernicious practice of self-abuse. It is much
to be regretted, that some medical writer, of talent and
estimation in society, has not turned his attention to the
subject, and given the influence of his name in denouncing
to the world the misery and devastation which are the unerring
consequences of this sordid and solitary vice. It is
indeed an unpleasant and thankless task; and there probably
exists in most minds, an unwillingness to enter upon
a subject in which there is so much difficulty in selecting
language sufficiently appropriate to exhibit the folly in its
true colors, without offending the ears of the chaste and
virtuous.</p>

<p>But a question of such paramount importance should not
be sacrificed to any false and prudish notions of delicacy;
I shall therefore offer such observations, as I may think
calculated to check the progress of a vice, that has done
more to demoralize the human mind than the whole catalogue
of existing causes besides. It may be deemed an
exaggeration, when it is stated that full three fourths of
the insane owe their malady to the effects of masturbation:
but the assertion is corroborated by one of the first
writers on medical jurisprudence, and is fully borne out
by the daily experience of proprietors of lunatic asylums.
The practice of self-abuse usually has its origin in boarding-schools,
and other places where young persons congregate
in numbers; and there are few of us who may have
observed the vice practised, although it may be unpleasant
to avow as much, that could resist the contamination.</p>

<div class="centered-poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“One sickly sheep infects the flock,</div>
      <div class="verse indentSMALL">And poisons all the rest.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And thus it is, though ninety-and-nine be pure and spotless
as the driven snow, if the hundredth be immoral, the
poison is soon disseminated, and the whole flock become
initiated into a vice, which, if indulged in, will blast their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
intellectual faculties, and probably consign them as outcasts
of society; rendering them slavering idiots, or the
inmates of a lunatic asylum. It is not only in private
schools that this sin rages, our public foundations and colleges
are not exempt from it. The heads of our universities
are particularly scrupulous in driving from their neighborhood
the frail fair, lest they should contaminate the
votaries of learning; while a vice far more degrading in
its practice, and infinitely more baneful in its effects, rages
within the very sanctuaries of classic lore. Many a brilliant
genius has sunk into fatuity beneath its degrading
influence. Loss of memory, idiocy, blindness,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> total impotence,
nervous debility, paralysis, strangury, &amp;c., are
among the unerring consequences of an indulgence in this
criminal passion. I need not bring a greater proof of the
dire effects of an indulgence in the practice of masturbation,
than the deplorable state of mind to which it reduced
one of our greatest poets.</p>

<p>The treatment of this delusive and mentally annihilating
propensity, falls equally within the province of the philosopher
and the physician. Without a total abandonment
of the practice, the case is hopeless; and he to whom the
consequences shall have been portrayed and heeds them
not, is unworthy of our sympathy, but deserves the evils
he entails upon himself.</p>

<p>Now, as the consequences of all criminalities continue
to ensue so long as the provocative be kept up, it is very
evident that, as a first step toward the restoration of order
and health, the cause must be removed or withheld. The
mere will or resolution is seldom sufficient: virtue, like
vice, has its allurements, and those belonging to the former
must be called into requisition as antagonists to the
snares of the latter. Physic can not check bad principles,
or bad indulgences. No method is or can be superior to
that full employment of the mental faculties on noble and
intellectual subjects, on objects worthy the high ends for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
which Nature has adapted them. And though the difficulty
will be great in inducing new and good habits, to the
exclusion of such as are unworthy and degrading, yet the
effectual accomplishment of such a resolution is not of uncommon
occurrence; and the sufferer may be placed under
circumstances where good habits may be more frequently
called into action naturally, to the exclusion of vicious
propensities. The time should be well filled, so as to
leave no room for flying to the various usual sources of
amusement that fill up the life of the thoughtless and gay.
Every hour and every minute should be provided for, so as
to exclude the admission of idleness and sloth, the forerunners
of mental and bodily disease. Studies connected
with education should be encouraged. Modern languages
have a great claim on the consideration of all who are engaged
in business to any extent, and are of incalculable
use after they have fulfilled the immediate end for which
their culture is here recommended. The various sciences
bearing more or less on the pursuits and employments of
every man, are earnestly recommended to the choice of the
unfortunate victim of sensuality. Geology and botany
would call him into the healthful fields, or fill up his time
by his fireside, in studying the many excellent works on
those subjects: the still higher utility of chemistry, as
being made of practical use in almost every business,
and demonstrating the else unintelligible phenomena
of a multitude of natural processes and changes, may
be held up as another inducement to call forth his best
energies.</p>

<p>Travelling, to those who can afford the expense or the
time, is one of the best means of conquering this baneful
habit. The numerous objects thereby presented to the
eye of the invalid in the manners, government, and productions
of art and nature, of the countries he visits, are
an incessant source of pleasing and useful excitement, and
can not fail, especially if the traveller be accompanied by
an intelligent and moral friend, to weaken and eradicate
the bad impressions of the past.</p>

<p>To diverge, and at the same time to conclude this part
of the subject, I have only to offer a few remarks relative
to the medical and therapeutic treatment of those cases of
impuissance, that age, disorganization, and total incapacity,
do not exclude from consideration. I have already
expressed my belief that generative imbecility is consecutive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
to general debility; hence, whatever tends to improve
the latter, tends also to remove the former. The diet,
therefore, should be full and generous, with a liberal proportion
of spices; but all stimulating liquids, such as wine,
brandy, and the rest, should be avoided.</p>

<p>Bathing, in its various forms, constitutes no unimportant
feature in the treatment; the cold plunging, the tepid
shower, the douche, the warm and the vapor baths, possess
their several influences. The various medicines that come
under the denomination of aphrodisiacs, are not wholly
uninfluential, such as stomachics, aromatics, gums and
balsams, oils, musk, opium, cantharides, strychnine, and
others; but as their administration can only be permitted
under professional direction, no real utility can follow any
specification or formulary of their proportions.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="no-page-break">OTHER FORMS OF SEXUAL DEBILITY.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Involuntary</span> seminal emissions are oftentimes very serious,
distressing, and intractable. They may be produced
in two ways—from continence, or by a high degree of
morbid irritability or weakness. The latter is by far the
more frequent; for the treatment of the former is obvious,
and generally effectual. The difference between seminal
discharges in persons of full health, and those morbidly
weak, is very opposite: in the former it is consequent
upon an erection, followed by an act of coitus; while in
the latter both are absent. The general debility in the
generative system, inseparable from morbid irritability,
occasions both a failure in the erection of the penis, and
an inability to retain the fluid in the secreting organs.
There is no doubt that this disposition to seminal emissions,
conjoined as it generally is with more or less deficiency
of the <i>vis virilis</i>, is too often owing to the habit of
self-abuse in early age. The testes usually wither in these
cases, and the patient becomes nearly, if not entirely, impuissant.
Sometimes these cases are attended by an excessive
irritability of the bladder, accompanied by pains in
the loins, kidneys, &amp;c. Their treatment consists in taking
nutritious and digestible food, to impart strength and invigorate
the constitution. Stimulants are at the same
time to be carefully avoided, except where great languor
and lassitude prevail. Abstemiousness in liquids is to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
enjoined. Habits of a relaxing nature should be avoided;
the patient, instead of sleeping on a soft, downy bed,
should lie on a firm mattress; the air of the room should
be preserved at a moderate temperature, and but few hours
should be allotted to sleep; he should pass much of his
time in the open air in a cool atmosphere; taking frequent
and moderate exercise, so that it does not occasion fatigue.
Cold bathing is a very important and essential part of the
treatment to be observed; the daily use of the <i>bidet</i>, or the
frequent application of a towel, dipped in cold water, to
the testes, applied twice or thrice a day, or the <i>douche
bath</i>, will be found of much service. To prescribe formulæ
for the various temperaments subject to this affection
would be to transcribe all the tonics from the pharmacopœia:
they are severally useful, but the various
preparations of iron surpass all others. During this
treatment the state of the mind should not be neglected:
no lascivious idea should be for a moment encouraged,
nor should the imagination be permitted to wander over
the works of fiction or romance in any way connected with
matters of love.</p>

<p>It not unfrequently happens that patients affected with
these complaints are apt to despond, and become miserably
depressed in spirits; to remove which, every recreation
should be encouraged to prevent them pondering over
their own situation, and, if possible, to divert the mind
from gloomy ideas: lively and agreeable company should
be courted; theatres, concerts, or any other rational
amusement consonant with the principles of the patient,
should be visited or pursued, and by an uninterrupted
perseverance in this mode of treatment for a sufficient
length of time, I have seen the most beneficial results
arise. The great art and difficulty in treating these
cases consist in giving tonics to a certain extent and no
further—avoiding excess, whereby we stimulate and produce
fever; or depletion, and induce debility. Early
hours, fresh air, exercise, attention to diet, the shower
bath, topical application of cold, with properly regulated
sexual intercourse, are rarely ineffectual in curing the
disease.</p>

<p>I could narrate many instances wherein the sexual desire
declined on the intervention of ordinary illness; any
powerful mental solicitude will suffice, but such a cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
is commonly remediable. Where the cause is traceable
to excesses and pernicious indulgences, if not accompanied
by disorganization, hope should not be abandoned; but
the patient should not cling to, or hang his reliance upon,
hole-and-corner speculators, or their advertised specifics.
He should consult men legitimately engaged in the profession,
in which, perhaps, more talent and honor are concentrated,
than in any other department of science.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> this disease is generally considered to be of a delicate
nature, and one about which the afflicted are unwilling to
speak, we shall say a few words on them. Piles constitute
a disease that may be very slow or very rapid in its
progress. The patient complains of an occasional itching
or soreness at the rectum after an evacuation, more particularly
if subject to constipation, or if he be an irregular
liver: when, after a while, he will be surprised on discovering,
subsequent to some straining effort, a knot of elastic
but irregularly formed tumors, of a size varying from a
hazel-nut to a horse-bean, springing out apparently from
the rectum, that in a few days, if they continue, will become
sore, and probably be attended with a discharge of
blood.</p>

<p>Now piles are nothing more nor less than <i>dilated veins</i>,
like varicose veins in the leg or any other part. The office
of veins is to receive the surplus blood of the arteries, after
having parted with that necessary supply for the nourishment
of every structure they are severally distributed to,
and to convey it back to the circulating organ, the heart—and
the mesenteric hœmorrhoidal veins, from their dependant
and confined position, the circulation in and above
them being liable to so many interruptions from the frequent
hardened state of the fæces in the rectum, become
distended with blood, which acting really like a wedge, dilates
them in time to the size we meet them. On the removal
of the cause, the blood flows on, and the swelling
subsides, and the patient feels no further inconvenience
until a recurrence of the pressure. After repeated attacks,
the veins become inflamed, and lymph, a sort of defensive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
mucus, is “thrown out” on the cellular membrane covering
the veins, and becomes organized into an indurated
texture, which increases with each attack of inflammation,
and at last gives them that fleshy appearance which resembles
a specific growth (see annexed cut).</p>

</div>

<p>The distinction between External and Internal Piles is as follows:
In both instances the same veins are diseased. In external piles, the
lowermost portion of the hœmorrhoidal veins are dilated, and are thrust
by the outer side of the rectum, carrying before them the common skin,
which dilates and constitutes the external coat of the piles. The
rectum is a portion of gut of four or five inches in length, and of
nearly a uniform width; the lower end, constituting the orifice, is, as
it were, tied round with a contracting and yielding band of muscular
fibres, forming a muscle called the <i>Sphincter Ani</i>. It is a muscle
of great power, and, from its connexion with the neighboring muscles
of similar strength, helps to afford that support to the contents of
the pelvis, that otherwise would descend, and be always forming a
projecting tumor. External piles consist, then, of a protrusion of the
hœmorrhoidal vein or veins between the cellular union of the sphincter
with other muscles, constituting, in fact, a hernia or rupture in the
perinœum. Internal piles is that condition of the hœmorrhoidal veins,
where, from their dilatation, they become protruded with the fæces,
when, from the contraction of the sphincter acting like a ligature,
they can not regain their situation until emptied of their contents.
Inflammation soon ensues, and the various changes I have and shall
hereafter consider take place.</p>

<p>Having stated the cause of piles, namely, pressure on,
and thereby prevention of, the circulation of the blood
through the hœmorrhoidal veins, it follows that persons
mostly annoyed with constipation must be the most likely
to be afflicted with piles; hence, free and intemperate livers,
great wine-bibbers, feeble and relaxed constitutions,
those, again, who take little exercise, and pregnant women,
and women who have borne many children, seldom
escape them. It is rarely that piles attack people in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
lower class of life, and those who have to work hard for
their livelihood and are much in the open air, which accounts
for the prevalence of this disease in the upper ranks
of society. The treatment of piles is very simple, if proceeded
with at the commencement of the complaint, the
grand object being to prevent constipation. An excellent
adjunct to the cure of incipient piles, is the warm bath.
Its tendency to overcome local congestions, and thereby
equalize the circulation of the blood, is well known. The
best medicine a hœmorrhoidal patient can take is Turkey
rhubarb, to be chewed freely, or castor oil, in doses of one
or two teaspoonfuls every morning, or some mild electuary,
which should be continued until the piles subside.</p>

<p>The diet during this treatment should be temperate and
laxative. Fruits should be used freely, and also coarse
bread, rye and Indian mush and molasses; wine and exhilarating
stimulants being avoided, and, where admissible,
as much out-door exercise taken as possible. An excellent
plan is also to inject half a pint or more of cold pump
or spring water up the rectum every morning, and suffer it
to remain for twenty or thirty minutes, if possible. Where
the piles have been of several days’ continuance, and are
very much swollen, puncturing them with a needle, and so
relieving the tension by evacuating, or at least diminishing
their contents, that the obstruction shall be overcome, is
serviceable. After this, pledgets of lint dipped in cold
water, the patient preserving the horizontal posture, may
be applied, or an astringent lotion may be used.</p>

<p>Where there is much swelling and inflammation, leeches
applied to the neighboring parts will afford relief. It is
impolitic, although some surgeons recommend it, to apply
leeches on the tumor, as the bites are oftentimes very difficult
to heal. Where the piles will admit of it, attempts
should be made to empty them, and press them to their
places, after which a pad may be worn to prevent their
descent. In the commencement of the disease, where
there is much heat and itching, a mild and astringent ointment
will prove of considerable utility, and a wash of powdered
opium, dissolved in flaxseed tea, will relieve pain and
soreness.</p>

<p>A very excellent and practical method in the treatment
of piles (the internal I am now speaking of) is to deposite
a pear-shaped bougie or pessary in the rectum, and suffer
it to remain as long as possible. The wearing of bougies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
gives no pain or even uneasiness, and the patient may
pursue his or her ordinary occupation without hinderance:
the bougie should be worn from one to several weeks. It
affords constant pressure against and support to the dilated
veins, and enables them to regain their tone and
strength; and I have known numerous instances where a
lasting cure has been effected. One of the most alarming
consequences of piles is hœmorrhage or bleeding; and it
is really wonderful what an extensive loss of that fluid a
patient can sustain. Day after day, and week after week,
have I known instances of constant bleeding from internal
piles, by which the constitution of the patient has been almost
broken up. This symptom mostly prevails with females,
nor is it limited, although more prevalent, to those
who are pregnant. There is naturally a strong objection
on the part of a delicate and susceptible female to submit
to a professional examination, and consequently it is rarely
done, until the urgent necessity of the case, lest death should
ensue, induces the patient to consult her medical adviser,
that he becomes acquainted with the real nature of the
case. Where there is ulceration of the piles, and they are
very numerous, and the bleeding frequent and profuse, the
only effectual cure is their removal. Where the operation
is objected to, the next method is to employ astringent enemata,
which must be regulated by the medical attendant.</p>

<p>The celebrated Weir’s balsam (248½ Grand Street) has
the credit of effecting miraculous cures. It is a medicine
of deserved repute, and ranks high with professional men.
Pitch pills have been extolled.</p>

<p>Now, where piles, both external and internal, do not
yield to the means suggested, or the patient may not think
proper to avail himself of them, the next best step is their
removal; and this is done either by excision or by ligature.
Both processes are safe in the hands of a medical man,
and are neither attended with any pain nor suffering worth
notice.</p>

<p>Among the annoyances incident to the rectum, is an occasional
preternatural contraction of the sphincter muscle.
It is generally the consequence of local irritation set up
by purgatives, by which the orifice becomes sore and excoriated,
which, if not timely relieved, ulcerates, constituting
cracks also, and in process of time a portion sloughs
away, and the adjacent edges unite, and thereby diminish
the calibre of the opening. This disease <i>may</i> be congenital,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
that is, the individual may be born with a contracted
or narrow sphincter. The treatment, naturally enough, is
to dilate the orifice, which is to be attempted by the introduction
of bougies, after the mode advised for the cure of
stricture, of which this in reality is a form. The cracks
of the sphincter are occasionally obstinate to heal; and the
ulceration will spread within the rectum. When that is
the case, the application of any stimulative ointment will
promote a healthy action.</p>

<p>In inveterate cases division of the sphincter is necessary,
which is to be done with a scalpel, and the incision should
be made from within laterally, by which injury to the perineum
is avoided. The operation is very simple, and by
no means painful or dangerous: the cure is perfect. Appropriate
medical treatment must not be neglected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> disease is often confounded with
piles; and as patients are generally diffident in submitting to an
examination, any extraordinary protrusion of piles they denominate
a falling of the gut. <i>Prolapsus Ani</i> is distinguished from piles
by the muscular coats of the intestine descending with the mucous
membrane, and forming a bag, like a pendulum, to the length of many
inches; the rectum, in fact, becomes everted, as we see the finger
part of gloves when turned inside out; and the inner membrane being
highly vascular, and the vessels in a congested state, it assumes a
blood-red appearance. The case is here well portrayed. Of course the
disease occasions much inconvenience and if not abated by appropriate
treatment, serious consequences ensue. Piles are most commonly the
cause of prolapsus, when, from the frequent and hard straining, the
gut at last descends, bringing the piles with it, which will be
seen winding around the upper part. When that is the case, the best
treatment is first to apply a ligature round the hœmorrhoids, and then return them
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
and the rectum together. Where the gut protrudes from
relaxation of the sphincter, the treatment depends upon
local support, for which there are many contrivances.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Astringent injections should also be used to give tone to
the parts, and medicines given to render the alvine evacuations
less hurtful. Children are very liable to prolapsus,
but with them a return of the fallen gut, and a brisk purgative
is all that is needed to prevent a repetition, provided
proper attention be paid to the bowels afterward—a
disturbance of the latter being, in most instances, the
cause. Where a rectum has been for a long time the seat
of disease, excrescences are apt to arise, resembling warts:
they may be removed without much pain, and with perfect
safety.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="no-page-break">STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rectum, it is presumed, is known to be the lower
portion of the intestines that leads to the outlet called, in
domestic language, the fundament. Now some writers
assert that the rectum answers the same purpose to the
bowels generally, as the urethra does to the bladder, while
others contend that it is a receptacle for the fæces previous
to their expulsion. We are all sensible, I think, that
it must answer both purposes; but it is also evident that
it is employed more for the former than the latter purpose.
The moment the rectum is full, there is a desire to empty
it, which is the best proof of its office; but circumstances
oftentimes forbid us, for even hours, obeying the summons,
which establishes its capability as a recipient. Well, the
rectum, consisting of muscular and membranous coats,
similar to the urethra, is alike subject to irritation, inflammation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
and ulceration, and imitatively gives forth
morbid and other secretions. The rectum, from its situation
and office, is very obnoxious to disease; and in addition
to those already enumerated, it is extremely liable
to become strictured.</p>

<p>Neither age nor sex are exempt from this strictural
change, although it more usually selects the grown up and
female portion of society. It is, generally speaking, the
consequence of constipation, or the reverse—diarrhœa or
dysentery—or it may follow in the wake of child-bearing.
Piles are a frequent precursor. The ordinary symptoms
are at first a slight difficulty in voiding the fæces, which
assume the form of the passage through which they have
to pass, presenting at one time a flattened tape-like shape,
at others a spiral appearance, and again the natural form,
but of very small diameter.</p>

<p>As the disease advances, the pain increases, upon going
to the water-closet, and after the act may be observed a
small or copious discharge of mucus, or blood, from the
anus. If the bowels be constipated, there is necessarily a
great deal of straining during fæcation, that soon establishes
spots of inflammation that rarely resolve, but run
on to ulceration; small lodgments then of fæcal matter
take place in the cellular membrane; and without detailing
the pathological phenomena, it may suffice to say, that
sooner or later the whole rectum becomes diseased, and
fistula, with its attendant miseries, lends a speedy help to
close life’s brief pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Patients afflicted with rectal diseases lose flesh rapidly.
From the constant pain and annoyance they endure, their
general health gets undermined, the digestion becomes
faulty, the countenance flags and looks care-worn, hectic
fever awaits the break-up of functional regularity, and a
lingering exhaustion closes the scene.</p>

<p>Stricture of the rectum is a curable disease; but the less
complicated, the greater are the chances of recovery. The
principles of treatment bear a near resemblance to those
for stricture of the urethra. After having ascertained the
situation and size of the contraction, a proper-sized bougie
may be introduced, and suffered to remain as long as
it occasions no inconvenience. The introduction should
be repeated every or every other day, increasing the size
of the bougie until the dilatation be fully perfected. After
vigilance is necessary to prevent a recurrence, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
bougie can not with propriety be entirely laid aside, or the
disease will return with increased violence. There are,
however, cases that require more imperative means, such
as the use of the <i>bistouri</i>, an instrument for the division of
stricture of the rectum, which, if the resort be objected to,
it behooves persons with the premonitory symptoms to attend
to them, that the operation may be rendered unnecessary.
There are many excellent palliative medicines
that the invalid will derive much comfort from in diseases
of the rectum; and enemata constitute a powerful means
of relief. The title of stricture of the rectum is fortunately
more familiar than the disease is frequent; and
what is more consolatory to persons of feeble health, the
complaint seldom extends beyond two or three inches from
the orifice, so that it need not be feared beyond the reach
of relief. See annexed <span class="nobreak">drawing:—</span></p>

<p>There are some surgeons who state all diseases to emanate
from a disordered liver, a weak stomach, or a “broken
wind;” and there are others in this town who are
never consulted but they deem the use of the rectum bougie
indispensable. The limit to structural disorganization
of the bowel is not afforded by stricture; there are, unfortunately,
many diseases springing therefrom, and many
totally independent of such; but their detail here would
exceed the titular object of the book. Enough has been
stated to convince any person teased with any of the enumerated

in his own opinion, it is impolitic to overlook or neglect

<p>The following diagram shows the bladder and its muscular
coats, and also its neck imbedded in the prostate
gland. The bladder is seen distended, and, of course, as
detached from the body. The kidneys are also seen—one
in its natural state, the other divided to show its inner
structure: the kidneys and their ureters are crossed to
save space in the sketch.</p>

<p>It is a very common observation with patients, that
they never were in better health in their lives than at the
moment of consulting their medical adviser, except in the
very particular malady, such as an ulcered limb, a teazing
cough, a gleety discharge, or an irritable bladder, that they
are seeking relief for; “they are quite well,” they say,
“in every other respect.” When illness attacks an individual,
it does not always announce its arrival by sound
of trumpet. It does not always come on like an apoplectic
shock: some minor organization is generally the first to
indicate disturbance in the healthy economy by even so
simple a presage (I will take for example, more especially
as the ensuing remarks bear upon the subject) as excretion
of disordered urine. To resume; the patient will
content himself, that the only fault in his system is the
disordered condition of his urine, and he earnestly seeks
for something to touch that particular symptom, forgetting
that trifling as he may fancy it, it is not merely owing to
the office of the kidneys and bladder, but to the blood itself,
whence the urine is formed, and to other circumstances
in the economy that influence it. Therefore, it is not
merely the urine which is at fault, but the state of it is a
pretty good indication of the general state of health; and
when it becomes vitiated, the urine is generally, unless
restored to a healthy condition, a forerunner of some more
serious evil. Still there are many variations in the character
and quality of the urine, and each depending upon
different causes—some upon a disordered state of the fluids
of the body, some upon one remote cause or another, deranging
the balance of the circulation, and inducing excessive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
perspiration, and the like; and certainly not the
least important, nor the least influential, exist in the very
structures that make (as it were) and receive the urine,
namely, the kidneys and bladder. I may observe here,
that chymists have detected upward of twenty different
substances, animal and saline, in its composition, but in a
state of complete solution. Of all these component parts,
the most important is an animal product named <i>urea</i>,
which exists in about the proportion of one in thirty to the
water containing it, while the other materials taken collectively,
water excepted, yield only about double the
quantity of the urea: hence, when the urine is disordered,
its specific gravity<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> is increased or diminished, as the case
may be; according to the abundance of the urea, and the
various proportions of the saline ingredients of the urine,
so is the urine thick, thin, acid, or alkaline, pale, or what
is called high colored. The various conditions of the urine
are ascertained by producing chymically certain decompositions,
or by suffering the urine to effect its own changes,
which, on being suffered to “stand,” sooner or later it
will.</p>

<p>Healthy urine is perfectly transparent and of a light
amber color; it yields an odor when warm resembling
violets. Its taste (for pathologists trust not only to sight
and smell) is saltish and offensive. As the urine cools, it
throws up what may be said to be a “urinous smell.” As
decomposition proceeds, the urine becomes cloudy, thick,
with shining floating patches on the surface; and lastly,
a thick deposite coats the bottom and sides of the vessel,
the whole giving forth at the same time a fetid ammoniacal
exhalation, as is perceived on entering public urinals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>
<p>The rapidity with which these several mutations occur,
affords some criterion of the healthy or disordered state
of the excretion we are talking about, and hence the usefulness
of examining especially the urine of persons laboring
under any disorder of the urinary system and functions
connected therewith. A patient will complain, for instance,
of irritable bladder. The symptoms of that complaint,
as far as pain and frequent desire to micturate exist,
very closely resemble those affections known by the
name of “Diabetes,” but which is distinguished from the
bladder affection in question by the quantity and character
of the urine. I purpose herein to enumerate, in as familiar
a manner as is possible, the various disordered states
of the urine which my experience has rendered me familiar
with, and to present the same as heretofore, in the form
of cases that have fallen under my notice.</p>

<p>Now, the urinary disorders that I purpose to collect a
description of, and exemplify, may be thus <span class="nobreak">enumerated:—</span></p>

<p>First, where too great a quantity of urine is voided.</p>

<p>Secondly, where too little is discharged; and also, where
suppression of it entirely occurs.</p>

<p>Thirdly, those states where the urine deposites a sediment,
of which two kinds are mostly prevalent, namely,
the Lithates or Acid, and the Earthy or Alkaline.</p>

<p>Fourthly, a brief exposition of the many but less frequent
morbid changes of the urine, in which certain salts
and substances, not existing in healthy urine, are precipitated
or held in solution.</p>

<p>And lastly, to add a few to the number of those already presented
herein, of the infirmities of those organs which
excrete the fluid under consideration, namely, the kidneys
and bladder.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="no-page-break">ON INCONTINENCE OF URINE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> this is not the professional term for the disease
I am principally about to speak of, yet under this
head will the reader, if he be an invalid laboring under a
complaint of this character, seek for a description of his
own case. Incontinence of urine implies a loss of the retentive
faculty of the bladder; but there is a species of
disease where micturition is carried to such an extent, that
a patient will attribute his leaky condition to the above
cause. Not so, however, is the case; the urine, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
disease alluded to, is generated or excreted in great quantity,
and the bladder merely fulfils its ordinary duty. Of
the affection known under the title of incontinence of
urine, most persons are aware that it is one of more frequent
occurrence in infancy than in adolescence; but the
latter is by no means exempt. In childhood it arises, in
all probability, from drinking too much, and the bladder
becomes, during sleep, overloaded, and runs over; or,
perhaps, from the irritability induced by its distension, becomes
excited to action, and so empties itself, the drowsy
state of the child rendering it insensible to the passing
circumstances.</p>

<p>The infirmity soon becomes a habit, which is often rendered
worse by the means taken to check it, namely, chastisement,
which is highly reprehensible. It is fortunately,
however, a disease that wears itself out as the child grows
up; and it may at all times be materially mitigated by a
little care and attention, such as inducing the child to micturate
before going to bed, and even awakening it before
the anticipated time when it usually is attacked with the
incontinence. The last fluid meal, which should be a spare
one, should be taken some hours before retiring to rest;
and if the complaint has gained much ascendency, medicines
which give tone to the bladder should be taken. I
have known the malady successfully removed, in a very
short time, by a combination of the sulphate of iron and
quinine, and any sedative extract, such as henbane or hops,
given in small doses in the form of pills. Female children
are more susceptible of the annoyance than males, probably
owing to the shortness of the urethra. Every measure
tending to give strength to the child should be used, such
as cold bathing, fresh air, or a change of the same, especially
if residing in the city, to the country. Mechanical
contrivances are to be had to collect the escape of urine,
whereby the offensive odor arising from the continually
soiled bed-linen may be avoided, and oftentimes the fretting
consequences of the urine passing over the person,
which induce excoriations and troublesome sores. There
are contrivances for both sexes. Where the disease prevails
in mid-life, it is generally traceable to early improvident
habits, and of course is the result of irritability and
debility of the bladder. There are many patients who can
somewhat control the functions of that organ while awake,
but have no power over it when asleep. The treatment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
depends a great deal upon the observance of abstemiousness
both in eating and drinking: a perseverance in
chalybeate remedies, both taken and administered internally
(I have injected the bladder of a person subject to
nightly incontinence of urine with various tonic preparations,
with very great and permanent relief); the use of
the warm bath, whereby the skin is brought into healthier
action (for it is generally arid, and parched when much
urine is voided), which tends to lessen the duty of the kidneys
and urinary system, should be adopted; nor should
exercise, that <i>pabulum vitæ</i> of even all feeble persons, be
disregarded. It is of the utmost importance for the preservation
of health, under all the circumstances in which we
may be placed. Escaping from this digression, I now proceed
to follow out the idea of the first paragraph of this
chapter, to treat of those complaints wherein the urine is
voided in excess. There is a disease commonly known by
the name of diabetes, wherein the prominent symptom is
a continual aptitude to pass urine, and in much greater
quantities than the fluid consumed as ordinary drink could
supply. This is one form of ailment of this class; but
there is another, happily less inimical to life, and which,
in the order of its frequency and simplicity, should take
precedence. It is that state of health, where the patient
is of that leaky habit, that whatever he takes runs through
him, and that very quickly too. Of course, such a condition
must depend upon a seriously-deranged constitution:
hence there is present a perpetual thirst, an entire perversion
of the perspiratory function, and a morbid condition
of many of the phenomena of life. Where this disease
springs up in early years, it becomes a habit proper to existence;
and although it may not seriously disturb the
economy of the being so as to lessen the duration of one’s
stay here, yet it furnishes a source of much solicitude, by
depriving us of rest, and shutting us out from society.</p>

<p>The patient (for such he or she may be truly called, and
the complaint invades both sexes) appears to have a perpetual
fever. Such is the desire for drink, that attested
cases record the circumstance of individuals consuming
from <i>one</i> to <i>two pailfuls</i> of water in twenty-four hours!
and I positively know an instance, at the moment of writing
this, of a child, fifteen years of age, consuming during
the night, notwithstanding a plentiful supply of liquids
during the day, a large jugful (two quarts) of water: the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
quantity of urine excreted is nearly equivalent. In this
case, the perspiration is profuse, and the child enjoys tolerably
good health, with the exception of being occasionally
nervous and hysterical. The case is under treatment,
and the quantity of fluid allowed is being daily diminished.
The urine on these occasions is aqueous, very pale, and of
little specific gravity; the properties of the urine otherwise
are not altered. These cases sometimes exist through life;
and if they do not terminate fatally, they ultimately enfeeble
the health, and predispose the patient, or, in other
words, render him less able to combat with ordinary complaints
common to us all, and thereby tend to the break-up
of his constitution.</p>

<p>There are many persons tipplers, not for the love of the
specific liquor, but from being always thirsty; and if we
reflect a little, we shall soon find how inclined we are to
encourage the habit. Since the introduction of tea into
this country, what inordinate quantities of that fluid are
consumed by individuals. They must, of course, dispose
of it, after having drunk it: the stomach can not retain it,
and it escapes either by the skin or kidneys, more usually
the latter. It is no uncommon thing for nurses, washerwomen,
and other females too, to swallow nine or a dozen
cups of tea at a sitting: they declare it is their best meal.</p>

<p>Man is a great deal more careful of the quadruped world
than the class he belongs to himself. He will stint his
horse drink, who works as much beyond his strength as
man does under his own, while he, the driver, will swill
till his mouth can scarcely receive another drop. The
moral of a volume might doubtlessly be expressed in very
few words, but then it would not be a volume, and, consequently,
would not be purchased or read; therefore, the
proposition herein intended to be presented to the reader
would exist unheeded. It is one thing to observe, that we
all drink too much, or that too much fluids are hurtful to
digestion and other functions, the public require some illustration
(which their own reflection would furnish, if
they used it), and hence this expense of verbosity to prove
the fact. As one of the consequences, then, of too great
an indulgence in fluids (I am here speaking of quantity
rather than quality), this form of complaint, wherein the
patient is perpetually desiring to urinate, is decidedly the
result; and, as all complaints have a beginning, this may
be considered as the first step toward setting up the several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
affections of the kidneys and bladder hereafter treated
upon. How important, then, is the arrest of this practice.
Where the inconvenience thus detailed is present, the
quantity of fluids must by degrees be diminished, the general
state of health must be studied. Dieting and warm-bathing
are two sheet-anchors, if properly applied. All
remedies tending to afford strength to the urinary system
must be had recourse to; and where the bladder loses any
of its retentive power, I entertain the greatest benefit from
an injection.</p>

<p>The next form of urinary disturbance of a proximate nature
to the one just described, is also where the urine is
discharged in large quantities; but, unlike the former, excreted
in greater abundance than the supply. The character
of the fluid is also different; it assumes two appearances,
modifications doubtlessly owing to the constitution of
the patient and the severity and length of the disease. It
is known by the name of diabetes: it is happily a complaint
the least frequent of urinary derangements, else,
from its obstinacy and difficult management, the slightest
urinary disorder would excite much just dread and apprehension.</p>

<p>The forms of the complaint thus vary: In the one instance,
there is a deficiency of the animal matter of the
urine, namely, the urea, and in the other, a superabundance
of it. In the former instance the urine is of a pale color,
and transparent, and sometimes like clear water, with a
very faint slight odor; whereas, in the latter it is generally
of a higher color, and now and then so thick as to resemble
brewer’s porter: it is decidedly a disease of great debility.
The symptoms are, a wearisomeness and languor
of the whole frame, a dry and crimpled state of the skin,
a sinking, gnawing pain at the pit of the stomach, the
bowels are obstinately bound, while a great thirst always
prevails. The body wastes to a mere skeleton, the discharge
of urine being almost constant, at least every hour,
accompanied with a call that must be immediately obeyed:
the leading feature in the composition of the urine, in addition
to the varied presence of the urea, is the saccharine
matter contained therein. It rarely attacks others than
those who have led an irregular life, or else have suffered
much from other kinds of sickness.</p>

<p>Diabetes is supposed to depend upon a perverted action
of the kidneys; but there is little dispute of its being a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
malady involving the whole process of animal economization.
The quantity of urine got rid of in a day has been
known to amount to ten quarts; as the disease continues,
the patient becomes much emaciated, the feet swell, and
he sinks into a state of low hectic fever; the urine discharged
continuing all this time to exceed nearly double
the amount of nourishment, liquid or solid, that is taken,
has given rise to the idea, that water is absorbed from the
atmosphere through the body. The disorder is generally
lingering, and, unless conquered, at last fatal. The treatment
embraces many remedies—bleeding, emetics, diaphoretics,
and sedatives, are mostly employed. It being a
complaint involving the necessity of constant professional
watchfulness, a more lengthened dissertation upon its peculiarities
will but little serve the patient. My own opinion
is, that the invalid must look for recovery—presuming
the initiatory symptoms have been duly attacked and subdued—to
careful diet, fresh air, varied scenery, and cheerful
society. Bathing, either vapor or warm, is immensely
useful; and, among the cases that have travelled across
my path (for patients laboring under diabetes, like any
other chronic ailment, generally take the round of the profession),
I have seen much and great good achieved by the
frequent employment of the bath.</p>

<p>As diabetes is mostly a sequence of some previous disturbance
of the urinary system, it the more behooves the
afflicted to heed the first noticial summons of attack: a
handful of water will sometimes quench a mouldering ember
that, suffered to rise into a flame, an engineful can not
extinguish. I may add, there is no cause so destructive to
virility as these drainages from the system through the
urethra—an additional reason why they should be attended
to upon their first appearance.</p>

<p><i>Cases where but a small quantity of urine is voided, terminating
in suppression, of urine.</i>—The most popular scientific
synonymes for complaints are but little understood by
men really of education; for, as yet, medical knowledge
forms not one of the items of collegiate lore, and few anticipate
sickness to render such acumen necessary. The
term “Strangury,” from the frequency of its occurrence, is
uppermost in most men’s minds; and they use it on all occasions
when there happens an interruption to the process
of making water. It is oftentimes misapplied. Strangury
implies a difficulty in voiding the urine, but it does not include<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
those cases wherein little is voided, because there is
little to void. The affection I am now about to make
mention of, is of the latter description. I have stated that
the urine is subject to a multitude of changes, that the
human frame is constituted to exist under a variety of circumstances,
and that occurrences are daily happening,
wherein its integrity is put to the test. Excesses, termed
sensual, and others, which in themselves might destroy
life, are counterbalanced by what may be styled the <i>safety-valves</i>
of the system. A violent fit of purging, perspiration,
or micturition, is often the means of warding off an
otherwise fatal blow. The skin, the bowels, and the kidneys,
are severally to be acted upon as emergencies demand:
instance the specific operations of diet and medicines.
The color of the urine is altered by (to give a popular
illustration) <i>rhubarb</i>; its odor, by <i>turpentine</i> (taken
internally, or from an inhalation of the vapor of them),
and by the well-known vegetable <i>asparagus</i>; and its composition
by alkaline and other chymicals. The function
of cutaneous exhalation is augmented or diminished by
warmth or cold; and the action of the bowels is suspended
or increased by innumerable substances, forming portions
of our daily food.</p>

<p>Analogous to these effects, is the result of certain conditions
of ill-health. A patient, laboring under fever or
inflammation of any important organ, will scarcely rid
himself of a wineglassful of blood-colored urine in the
twenty-four hours; and there are many forms of ailments,
where the function of separating the urine from the blood,
or even the function of supplying the kidneys with that
vital fluid, are suspended, partially or entirely. Few of
us have escaped attacks of this kind; they are sure to follow
long-pursued habits of dissipation, or even occasional
displays of it; and they are often the result of accidents
over which we have but little control. A patient will
complain of a frequent desire to make water; each effort
so to do, will be accompanied with excruciating pain. A
small quantity, or a few drops only, will dribble away, excoriating
the passage as though vinegar was passing over
it, and putting on an appearance almost resembling muddy
port wine, or a thick solution or suspension of brick dust:
there will be present much fever and constitutional disturbance.
The patient may have shivering fits, pain round
the loins, down the thighs, and over the lower part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
abdomen. He will betray a readiness to submit to anything,
although conscious that his bladder is empty, notwithstanding
the violent and urgent efforts at straining,
which he is continually being called upon to make, as
though his bladder were distended, and ready to burst.
On passing the catheter (I am supposing a severe case,
where retention of urine has at last occurred), not a drop
will flow, and the danger of the disease is thereby made
apparent. Except very severe measures be adopted, which
it would be idle here to lay down, the case is sure to terminate
fatally. Instances are recorded, where that event
has been retarded upward of a week, during which time
the patient voided not one drop of urine.</p>

<p>The absolute cause of the disease is very obscure; but
it has a beginning, and to those only who suffer from a
long-continued diminution in this natural excretion, and
who disregard it, is this picture presented.</p>

<p>The treatment, in advanced stages of the disease, is
strictly professional; but the warning of the altered character
of a customary evacuation, should not for a moment
be disregarded.</p>

<p>Suppression of urine is very different from retention:
in the former, there is none to excrete; in the latter, its
escape is impeded. In the chapter on stricture, the cause
and manner of retention is explained, and the mode of relief
laid down, whereby the invalid himself has a remedy
at hand; but, in suppression, the resource is neither so
ready nor so effectual. It is, therefore, much wiser to notice
the first alteration, and to be prompt in seeking the
nearest aid. Every practitioner is acquainted with such.
Although such are not ever present, even in the most extensive
practice, still they do occur; and much as this
mode of frightening a patient may be condemned, knowing
the frequently existing disinclination toward “laying up,”
yet, if it only induce a fellow-mortal to take the tenth instead
of the eleventh hour, one life may be saved, and the
writer can well submit to the disapproval and contempt
of the thoughtless and indifferent.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break">THE GRAVEL.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> the head of this disease may be classed all those
urinary affections, wherein a sandy deposite is observed,
after the urine has stood some time. This sandy excretion
varies in its composition, in the quantity voided, and in its
continuance: and it is also often separated, for it is held
generally in solution in the urine as it comes from the
bladder, while in the bladder or in the kidneys; and
hence we find gravel in the kidneys, in the bladder, and
in the urine. Where it is precipitated, or formed in the
kidneys or bladder, it is apt to accumulate, and constitute
what is called “Stone” in those organs. As I have just
observed, the composition of this gravel differs, and differs
also at different times in the same individual, according to
circumstances. Stones have been detected that, like the
rolling snowball, gather up, as they increase in size, whatever
comes in their way; and, accordingly, as the deposites
are principally composed of concretions, termed, in
chymical phraseology, “Lithates” and “Phosphates,”
stones are frequently found to be formed, first of a layer
of one covering, then of another, and so on.</p>

<p>Gravel may exist for years without inducing much disturbance
of health, or it may produce serious inconvenience
in a very short time. The urine being acid, holds the
salts which it contains in solution; and, therefore, if the
acid predominate, it becomes, through its own excess,
thrown down, when it is detected in the form of red sand;
but if there be an insufficiency of acid, the earths and salts
of the urine are thrown down, and they exhibit their existence
in the form of white gravel. Hence the two names
“Red” and “White Gravel.” Acidulated urine is looked
upon as certainly indicative of health, and when in excess,
of a high tone of health; which, as the degree ascends,
is marked by inflammation and fever. Alkaline
urine betokens feebleness of constitution, or interrupted
health. High living and an excited life induce red gravel;
irregular, or an impoverished living, with much mental
inquietude and physical exhaustion, establish white gravel.
The fact of gravel being known to exist without forming
stone, is no justification to suffer it to incur even the
chance of such a finale. There is no class of diseases so
painful and distressing as those wherein the function of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
the kidneys or bladder is interrupted, and the majority of
these affections are ushered in by a derangement of the
urinary fluid.</p>

<p><i>Cause of Gravel.</i>—The cause of gravel is owing to
chymical affinities. The urine, among its other constituents,
contains <i>lithic acid</i> and <i>ammonia</i>, which two, in
healthy urine, are combined and held in solution. If any
other acid, as may be instanced in expelled urine, possessing
a greater affinity for the <i>ammonia</i> than the <i>lithic
acid</i>, be added, the <i>lithic</i> will be thrown down. The same
process takes place when effected in the system, the
source of which new acid is the stomach, which, when in
an irritable and feeble state, as in indigestion, furnishes
or abounds with muriatic acid. In like manner, the urine
containing salts, called phosphate of lime, ammonia, and
magnesia, on receiving an additional quantity of ammonia,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
the lime, for the less affinity to phosphoric acid than
the ammonia, is thrown down; and hence a salt, bearing
its name, is generated, either to be expelled like gravel,
or to feed a nucleus already existing in the bladder.
These chymical changes are produced by the causes before
enumerated. We are subject to an infinitude of laws:
we are perpetually changing, and these changes may fairly
be stated as chymical affinities: it is owing to such, that
the absorption of fluids, and the deposition of substances,
which exist more or less in all derangements of health,
ensue—to such, that we resist death, and to such that we
become its prey. Gravel is a disease not so productive
of fear or suffering, so long as it escapes when formed;
but there are so many circumstances that may give rise to
the formation of stone, that sandy urine should always
command notice and treatment. A clot or point of blood,
that may have been discharged from irritation of the kidney
or bladder, is often found to form the nucleus of a
stone: the slightest substance, once in the bladder, is apt
to form a basis for accumulation: a pin, a fragment of a
bougie, or any instrument, hair, wood, and numberless other
things that have found their way into the bladder, have
given rise to the formidable and distressing complaint of
stone.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of Gravel.</i>—It is not to be anticipated that
every person is prone to excrete gravelly urine, else certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
dietetics, that evidently give rise to the same in particular
instances, had better at once be removed from the
list of articles of food, and their use prohibited altogether;
but there are instances where a constitutional disposition
exists in particular families, that is even transmitted from
generation to generation, to calculous diseases, and in
those cases, every precaution should be taken to avoid
even their development.</p>

<p>The antidotes to the disposition to gravelly urine are, exercise,
temperance, and the adoption of all those means
that tend to promote a healthy action of the skin and kidneys,
namely, the warm bath—it is a perfect talisman in
these affections—it needs but little eulogy; the comfort
and relief, where relief is sought, afforded on the first experiment,
best bespeak its praise. It is decidedly one of
the most useful adjunctive prophylactic measures we have.</p>

<p>I have already stated, that disorders of the urine arrange
themselves under two great heads—the acid and the alkaline
prevalence. The treatment is to neutralize the excess
of either: the acid diathesis, as it is called, is considered
a less healthy deviation than the alkaline, and is looked
upon as indicative of greater constitutional break-up. The
medicines most in vogue in gravelly disorders are, turpentine
(to increase the formation of lithic acid), sulphuric,
nitric, and muriatic acids; while the antagonists to that
form of the disease, wherein the above are given, consist
of ammonia, potass, and soda. The great object, however,
is to balance the health, to allay irritation, and tranquillize
the morbid uproar of the system. Here we have an extensive
field to select from in the class of sedatives. Opium,
perhaps, is the best—the most to be depended upon, its
properties being best known; the warm bath comes next;
and lastly, the various tonics and astringents of our pharmacopœia,
of which quinine, uva ursi, pareira brava, achillæ
millefoliæ, buchu, &amp;c., &amp;c., stand foremost.</p>

<p>Although the lithic acid deposition is the most frequent,
still, as the disease advances, there is a strong tendency to
the formation of the alkaline; and as the remedies for the
former are apt to accelerate the latter disorder, it is most
important that the urine should undergo frequent examination
to regulate the treatment. To recapitulate the
substance of this article, it may be stated, that gravel is a
disease, not dangerous in itself, but that it is always the
forerunner, although not always productive, of stone;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
stone being formed by the collection and chymical union
of the sand itself. This collection takes place in the kidney,
the ureters (the vessels that convey the urine to the
bladder), the bladder, and sometimes in the urethra. The
stone so formed varies in its composition and size, and is
one of the saddest ills that can befall human nature. Hence
the importance of watching, and attending to every urinary
disturbance, of which gravel forms a prominent feature,
the treatment of which has been already stated; but which,
as it involves more practised judgment than a non-professional
invalid can be supposed to possess, had better be
intrusted only to professional hands.</p>

To enter into a description of the pathological condition of the
bladder in the several states of irritability, paralysis, and inflammation,
would be to swell this article to an inordinate length, and
serve no useful purpose—the symptoms and treatment comprising
the most essential knowledge for the patient to possess. It may
be briefly stated, that the bladder is less subject to become disorganized
(the function being chiefly the disordered symptom), and
sooner even regains its tone than other organs not less important
to life.</p></div>

<i>Mercury.</i></p>

<p class="fn-para">The preparations of mercury are various: but those chiefly employed
in the treatment of syphilis are the oxymuriate, or bi-chloride,
the submuriate, or chloride, the red precipitate, or the hydrargyri
nitrico-oxydum, the blue pill, the red sulphate for fumigations,
and the blue ointment.</p>

<p class="fn-para">Ptyalism or salivation, which implies an extraordinary secretion
of the salivary and other glands, occasioned by the taking of mercury,
inasmuch that when carried to an unwarrantable extent, ulceration
is the consequence, may be produced by the internal exhibition
or external application of almost any of its preparations.
With this view, however, the blue pill is usually administered in
doses of five grains twice a day, or the blue ointment is directed to
be rubbed in on the inner part of the legs and thighs, in quantities
varying from one to two drachms night and morning. Mercury,
when given to excite ptyalism, is generally taken in conjunction
with sarsaparilla (see Form 51, or the fluid extract). The symptoms
whereby the effects of mercury are ascertained, are a coppery taste
in the mouth, followed by a tenderness of the gums on mastication,
an increased flow of the saliva, and a peculiar fœtor of the breath.
It is usual, on the tainted taste being perceptible, to diminish or
discontinue the further use of the medicine, unless the case be very
severe, or merely to keep up the effect produced. But it can not
be denied that, although sufficiently manageable in scientific hands,
mercury, or any one of its preparations, is too powerful to be taken
indiscriminately.</p></div>

<i>Antimony.</i></p>

<p class="fn-para">The preparations of antimony consist of the precipitated sulphuret,
called now the oxysulphuret of antimony, and the powder, as
directed to be made in the Pharmacopœia, or its secret modification,
known by the name of “Dr. James’s Powder.” The sulphuret enters
into the composition of the red or Plummer’s pills, which is an
admirable alterative, given in conjunction with sarsaparilla, in doses
of five grains, once or twice a day. The James’s powder, with the
like intention, may be taken in two or three grain doses twice or
thrice a day.</p></div>

The membrane containing the liquid comes away with the after-birth
or placenta; but when it is brought away with the child’s
head, it is named a “caul,” to which the ignorant attach a superstitious
belief that it saves the possessor from drowning, and hence
it has been a source of traffic between the cunning and the weak-minded.
Cauls are made by detaching the membrane from the placenta.</p></div>

A patient was admitted into the ophthalmic wards of the Hotel
Dieu, Paris, with great weakness of sight, amounting almost to
amaurosis. He confessed that he was in the habit of polluting
himself, and that he was immediately seized with complete blindness
whenever he addicted himself to the practice. Cases very
similar to the above have been noticed by Dr. Doane, of New York,
who has paid great attention to diseases of this character.</p></div>

The convertibility of India-rubber to so many useful purposes
has not escaped the attention of surgeons, and it is found to be an
excellent material for trusses, pessaries, bougies, &amp;c., and consequently
much used for them. I find them in my own practice far
preferable to metallic or any other description. Many cases of
hæmorrhoids, as well as of prolapsus, that have been given up as
incurable, on account of the parties objecting to wear metallic instruments,
or submit to the operation of excision or ligature, have
speedily yielded to the application of the same manufactured of India-rubber;
indeed, every day’s experience so convinces me of their
superiority and efficacy as a remedy in these disorders, that a patient
afflicted with the most formidable form of either disease need not
despair of a prompt and certain recovery.</p></div>

The specific gravity of the urine materially depends upon those
causes which act diuretically, and upon the quantity of fluids swallowed,
which, if taken in excess, of course increases the watery
portion of the urine, and vice versa. The density of the urine is
ascertained by an instrument called an “Hydrometer,” which, upon
being immersed in the urine, indicates its specific gravity. The
usual specific gravity of healthy human urine varies from 1.010 to
1.015, while the temperature ranges from 75 degrees of Fahrenheit
to 120. The quantity averages from two to three pints per diem,
but depends not only upon the quantity of fluids consumed, but also
upon the nature of the food, vegetables generating more urine than
animal substances. In infancy and old age, the temperature of the
urine is below this standard, but nearly equivalent to each other;
whereas it is only at the period of puberty that the temperature
noted exists.</p></div>

<p class="TN-style-1">Obvious punctuation errors in the transcribed text have been repaired.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">Variations in spelling are common in this book. In the case of medical terms
in which the ligatures ‘æ’ and ‘œ’ could be used, the variations are
numerous and noticeable. Thus we find the terms “hemorrhage”, “hæmorrhage” and
“hœmorrhage” being used interchangeably. Similarly for “hæmorrhoids”
and “hœmorrhoids” and all the words derived from the foregoing terms.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">Except as noted below, unusual or variable spelling and hyphenation as
published in the original book have been retained.</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 89 — “accompanying” changed to “above” (Witness the above wood-cut.)</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 149 — “ipresses” changed to “impresses” (the womb impresses upon the bladder)</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 167 — “Henry III.” changed to “Henry II.” (Henry II. consulted one Fernal for the infertility of his queen, Catherine de Medicis)</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 196 — “protusion” changed to “protrusion” (extraordinary protrusion of piles)</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 200 — “bladders” changed to “bladder” (into the bladder whence it is voided)</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 214 — “pharmacopœa” changed to “pharmacopœia” (of our pharmacopœia)</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">In anatomical references, the book uses “chord” throughout in place of
“cord” — see for example “umbilical chord” and “spermatic chord”.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">There are seventy-nine treatment recipes/formulæ
(“Forms”) in the book. All are printed in a similar style. However
fifty-five appear as footnotes while the rest appear in page text.
For ease of reference in the transcription, all the footnoted Forms
have been gathered together and moved to a new FORMULÆ annex at the
end of the book. Minor changes to the page text consequent on the new
arrangement are as follows:</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 31 — “[See annexed Formulæ 2, 3, 4, 5.]” changed to “[See Forms 2, 3, 4, 5 in Formulæ annex.]”</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 33 — “Subjoined are” changed to “See Formulæ annex for”</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 34 — “(see note)” changed to “(see Formulæ annex)”</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">While the original style and content of the
seventy-nine Forms has been carefully preserved, minor corrections
to the layout of some have been made so that all are displayed to
the reader in a consistent format. This avoids small but distracting
variations on a page that look like errors in transcription. For the
same reason, variations in the spelling of dosage measures in the
Forms have been regularised. Thus “table spoonful”, “table-spoonful”
and “tablespoonful” all appear as “tablespoonful”. Similarly for
“teaspoonful” and “wineglassful”. Plural forms have been changed in the
same way. For consistency, the regularising of these words has also
been applied to their appearance elsewhere in the body text.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">Ordinary footnotes have been re-indexed using
numbers and moved to a FOOTNOTES section placed after the FORMULÆ
annex.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">References on a page to originally footnoted
Forms are now clickable links to their text in the new FORMULÆ annex.
Ordinary footnote references on a page are now clickable links to their
text in the FOOTNOTES section.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1 brhide">For technical reasons beyond the control
of the transcriber, long chapters in this EPUB version have had to
be partitioned into smaller segments of text and illustrations. The
reader will see the break between each segment represented as a
‘thought break’. They appear at places in the chapter where the author
has started a new subject for discussion. These are easily recognised
because the author features the subject title in <i>italic font</i> as
the first sentence of a new paragraph. The following extract is an
example:</p>

<p class="TN-style-1A brhide"><i>The Surgical Treatment of
Gonorrhœa.</i>—The principal symptoms ....</p>

<p class="TN-style-1 brhide">When a thought break occurs before such
a paragraph, it is displayed to the reader as a short, centered, rule
thus:</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
